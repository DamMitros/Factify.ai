48,0,1,0.854377031326294,0.14562295377254486,"I believe that the use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable and useful. Imagine this, you are a child in a boring old science or math class and you are frowning and you are just so bored. Then all of a sudden your teacher is making the lesson more interesting by adding superheros or music. How did she do that? Now put yourself into the shoes of the teacher in that situation. You look on your computer and see that your whole class is bored and angry. Why not make this more interesting by putting on upbeat music and adding glitter and bright colors to your notes? That is what you can do with this new technology.

This technology would be really useful in all the classrooms. If you put it on the teachers computers it would really bring the childrens grades up and hopefully keep them interested and thinking about what tomorrows lesson is going to be like. With this new technology it might even keep kids out of trouble just so they won't miss their favorite class with their new favorite teacher.

The text has many many pros of why you would want this program in classrooms. In paragraph one it states, ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percest disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This is when they were talking about the Mona Lisa. The Facial Action Coding System shows all the emotion Mona Lisa was showing even though it is a painting and was painted a very long time ago. In paragraph three the text states, ""happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" and paragraph four, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face."" These examples show all the emotions it can identify, such as the Mona Lisa and her mixed emotions. Another quote says, ""For instance you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" The last two example and quotes I gave prove how intelligent this machine is. It can identify emotions better thanus humans, and we make the facial expressions!

This technology may be great and all but the only downside is that you can not have it on your laptop, the text states, ""Your home PC can't handles the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" This has some pros and some cons. One con in the text says, ""Imagine a computer thqat knows when you're happy or sad, For examples, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" That could be really upsetting considering how annoying some ads are. For example if you have a cat but it is showing an ad for bird food, what will that be useful for?

If teachers couldn't have the program for the Facial Action Coding System on their school computers they could always jusrt smile and try to be happy. In paragrqaph nine the text states, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" The author also states, ""A renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions."" This shows that of a teacher smiles or laughs or changes her voice to a more upbeat pitch, the students may be more happy with the lesson.",663

No matter how meaningless you think the decision may be, every outcome will effect the path of your life in one way or another. When making a decision, it is important to seek advice from others to ensure that you are making the correct choice. In the process of seeking advice regarding a certain issue, it is extremely beneficial to receive multiple opinions rather than just one because this will allow you to visualize all the possible outcomes to your decision and experience how different lifestyles interpret your problem and its solutions.

When interpreting different solutions, there is never going to be only a single route around the obstacle that life throws your way. Imagining all of the possible outcomes to a decision will allow you to weigh the pros and cons. For example, visualize yourself in a scenario in which you have to choose between furthering your education after graduating high school, or getting a job to start earning money. Some benefits to furthering your education are that it will not only allow you to become an expert in a particular region of work, but it may influence the decision of future managers seeking employees. This is because when your resume shows that you went to a university, this will impact their choice when picking you over someone who didn't make the choice to further their education after graduating high school. On the other hand, upon completion of all twelve grades, continuing to learn is no longer free. Not only is college extremely expensive once you have been excepted, but even sending in an application costs money and you are't even guaranteed to get in. Furthermore, while going to school to become more educated is a go-to for some, many others may believe that after high school, earning money, in order to be able to support a family in the present or future, is more important. Nowadays, money has a large influence on everybody because it has become a huge factor of survival. Social media influencers along with simple waitress's in small town restaurant's depend on the gains of money to be able to live. Earning money is vital to some while earning an education is just as important for others. Moreover, in this situation you may think that there are only two routes when choosing to further your knowledge versus earning money by getting a job, but that would be incorrect. It has been made possible to further an education while being employed. Technology has made a great impact on those who value both money and education. Online classes are easily available to those who have any electronic devices. Being in an online course allows a person to learn and complete work on their own time. Overall, there is always another choice to make and hearing everyone's different opinions allows you to weigh the pros and cons of each outcome.

Everybody's lifestyles are different. People were raised to believe certain things and to have varying morals. In addition to weighing the pros and cons of a decision to result in the best possible outcome, receiving the opinions of multiple people is beneficial because it allows you to view the world in contrasting ways. Being placed in someone else's shoes opens your eyes up to different points of view. This will allow you to pick the decision that would have the least amount of conflict among a group of people with mixed beliefs. For example, picture a scenario in which you have to make the decision between wearing a blue or red dress. It would benefit you if you were to ask the opinions of multiple people to see which dress was voted for the most. In the end, the outcome of picking the dress that people viewed as best would result in more positive responses when you were to actually wear the dress to an event. This comes to show that asking the opinions of several people allows for an anonymous agreement to be made.

In conclusion, it is beneficial to seek the advice of multiple people when making a decision because it allows you to visualize all of the possible outcomes and weigh the pros and cons of your solutions. As a result of hearing multiple opinions, you are more likely to pick the best solution to a conflict in your life.",733
180,0,1,0.9999488592147827,5.118921762914397e-05,"By centering the article around technology that that is able to read students' emotions, Nick D'Alto makes a great case that this developement would be a direct benefit to the learning environment. If this new technology is implemented in schools, educators will see test scores rise and see positive behavioral effects in children because of the use of emotion reading technology.

One of the most important aspects to consider when designing an education experience is whether or not it is beneficial, and more importantly, if it will keep students engaged. Dr Huang theorizes is paragraph 6 that a classroom computer could recognize when a student becomes distracted or confused, and the computer could alter the lesson and make it more useful. This could largely impact the education system by allowing each and every individual student to have a customized lesson plan based on their reactions to the origional one. With this new innovation, schools could become more efficient and churn out more successful students than ever before.

One of the many duties a teacher has is educating the students, but one of the most important roles a teacher can play in a students life is implementing discipline. As described in paragraph 8, this technology has the ability to screen people on whether they are being truthful or deceitful. Just like lying politicians, kids can get away with a lot. If bad habits continue to follow them throughout school, they will end up with a criminal potential later in life. Emotion reading technology could possibly save a students future if the teacher could read if the kid is being truthful or not. If a young child is found to be lying, the teacer could effectively discipline the kid and end the bad habit at an early age. Another example would be if kids are really telling the truth if they understand the lesson or not. If kids are truly confused and won't admit it, the emotion sensing technology would read their faces and the teacher would be alerted that the students don't undestand the lesson. These forms of accountability would instill morals and discipline in children and prevent them from forming bad habits at a young age, and eventually lead to a better and more just society.

Overall, emotion reading technology would be a strong benefit to society and specifically the education system. By being able to understand eachother better, the human population has the ability to evolve and become more intelligent, compassionate, and responsible. If it takes a new technology to bring people a higher understanding of eachother, than that technology should be implemented in not just the education system, but many other institutions around the world.",447
198,0,1,0.9999656677246094,3.436542465351522e-05,"Over the last two decades, cell phones have become very popular. Today, almost everyone has a cell phone, especially if they are old enough to drive. Cell phone use while driving has become a big controversy over the last few years and many people have faced the consequences of texting, calling, or searching their cell phones while operating a vehicle. With that being said, there are several reasons why people should not use their phones while driving. These reasons can be classified into a couple of different categories, including safety and legal reasons.

The first reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it can result in injury or death for the driver or someone else. This could pose a safety hazard and would therefore fall under the safety category. Statistically, there are 1.6 million car crashes that are caused by texting and driving each year. Almost 390,000 injuries each year from accidents involve a cell phone or other device. Also, 1 out of every 4 car accidents are caused by texting and driving in the U.S. Therefore, there is always a risk that an accident will happen as a result of cell phone use and could harm anyone involved in the accident.

The second reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it can result in property damage for the driver or someone else, which could pose a safety hazard but could also result in someone pressing charges. Therefore, this could be classified under the safety category and the legal category. As mentioned above, crashes due to cell phone use while driving are very common in the United States. It can cause damage to other vehicles, houses, and or company buildings. Whatever your insurance doesn't cover you have to pay out of pocket and these damages can get really expensive. Any insurance claim could also cause your monthly payments to go up.

The last reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it is against the law in many states such as Georgia, which would fall under the legal category. On July 1, 2018, Georgia passed a Hands-Free law that basically says that anyone driving a motor vehicle on a highway in Georgia is not allowed to hold a phone with any part of their bodies. A first-time offense for using a cell phone and driving is $50, the second is $100, and the third is $150. Each offense after the third one is also $150 each. Every offense is a misdemeanor that would go on your permanent record.

There are multiple reasons why you should not use your phone while driving. This distracted driving can lead to car wrecks that could cause harm to you, to someone in your car, or to anyone else involved in the accident. An accident could also cause damage to your car, to someone else's car, or to homes, buildings, and other property damage. It is also illegal in many other states so if you are caught you could be fined up to $150 and it would go on your permanent record. Because of these potential safety hazards and legal issues, it is best to not use a cell phone while driving a vehicle.",540
201,0,1,0.9999433755874634,5.6654505897313356e-05,"You're the president of your school. You decide to plan a field trip to a zoo in another state. Your Principal warns you that it's too far away, and that the buses won't make it back to school before the end of the day. You don't take his advice. Halfway back from the trip, it's dark outside and the bus runs out of gas. You also forgot about feeding the students for dinner. You wished you had planned better and took your Principal's advice.

In our everyday lives, seeking the opinions of others can help you make a more well-rounded decision that benefits more than one person, but may take away some of you original intentions. Decisions that include more than one person sometimes require a leader to think this way. If people were to go about thinking only of their own opinions, then we would have a selfish world. By looking for others' opinions, we are humbling ourselves and looking at the greater good. Searching for multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

As you may know, everyone in this world thinks a little differently on any given subject. No one person can make a perfect decision for the rest of his/her peers. In 2019, a study by Willits University was taken across the country that asked many average Americans what kind of pizza they would exclusively eat for the rest of their lives. According to the data, 20% of Americans said they would eat pepperoni, 10% would eat Meat Lover's, 15% would eat vegetable pizza, 30% would eat cheese, and 25% said they would eat Hawaiian. If one person were to decide the type of pizza everyone else were to eat for the rest of their lives, then at least 70% of people would not get their preferred pizza. It's just not possible to make a decision that benefits everyone using only their own resources. Preferences of others are unclear to just one person. When we look for others' opinions, we find a way to possibly make a lot more people get the outcome they want.

Additionally, looking at the past and present of our government and most businesses, leaders have many advisers to help them make the best outcome decision. Most leaders that hold high positions are powerful, and can make decisions that take thousands, if not millions of dollars. Leaders, like the President, need to make smart decisions that don't lead to negative consequences. Because of this, the President has cabinet members, which act like advisers for him. They help him decide which government organizations and projects to fund, and which not to fund. Generic_Name, one of the President's cabinet members says, ""The President has to look at the big picture; he needs to work and find the needs and opinions of the people to solve problems."" Leaders have to find an overall decision that benefits many people at once. Government funded public services are built around providing service that benefits many people. In fact, our entire government's structure is designed to shoot down any single-opinion behavior from any one of the three branches of our government by the checks and balances system. If the President's budget plan isn't supportive of a 'need' that congress thinks it is missing, they don't approve it. When leaders seek multiple opinions, they make a choice that supports large amounts of people, not just themself.

Similarly, the strategy of seeking multiple opinions relates to experimentation in science. When taking an experiment, multiple trials are done to eliminate errors and find an average in the data. The individual opinions of others are all slightly different, just like the individual values in data collecting. In decision making there is an outcome decision that is the average of everyone's individual opinions, and in data collection, the result is the average of all the values recorded in the experiment. Generic_Name, a professor in the field of psychology once said in an article, ""Because the two [decision making and data collection] are so similar, each individual opinion is like a data point, so any opinion that is off from the others could be considered as an 'error'. When we try to make an average outcome decision, we are essentially eliminating errors, just like in data collection."" In psychology, survey and test data is something that psychologists deal with all the time. By eliminating 'errors' and averaging everyone's opinions together, we get a more accurate outcome.

To sum everything up, a better decision is made by seeking multiple opinions from others. By doing this, we are looking at the big picture and are more likely to come up with an overall outcome that benefits everyone . Nobody has the exact same opinion, so nobody can make decisions for everyone else. Leaders of businesses and even the government, like the President, have advisers. The strategy of making an overall opinion even relates to accurate data collection in science. No matter what, the decision almost always has to be a compromise. If we were to go about in our lives only planning by ourselves and thinking selfishly--you may as well be stuck in that bus with no fuel on the side of the highway in the middle of the night.",874
208,0,1,0.9997389912605286,0.0002609891816973686,"In this essay I will be writing an argumentative essay over ""The Face on Mars"" theory. This is a very argumentative subject that can have two sides to itt based on the factual evidence in the passage.""The Face on Mars"" was consider to have been made by alien lifeform. ""The Face on Mars"" is 2 miles long and is a major pop icon.

I think ""The Face on Mars"" is just a huge rock formation that was formed by the planet's weathering and erosion from nearby rocks. Since this planet has a rain season and has a very windy winter, it could've been made by weathering and erosion. Another thing that makes me believe that the face is just a rock is because the dark eyes, nose, and mouth look like shadows from the camera and the sun. One last thing about the face is that if alien lifeform made this why woud they make it 2 miles wide? This has just been one side of the argument, I will write the rest.

I think that this face is made by alien lifeform because it really looks a face. This face could've possibly been a temple or worshiping place for these lifeforms long ago. It could've been a tomb for their leader or king that might've died. If these aliens were going to make a rock this big and that wide it would be for someone or something to catch it's eye. So aliens could've made this or they might not have.

I think that ultimately this is just a coincidence because if aliens are real or were real we would have got aa picture of one or saw some remains of one. And the rock is probably just a mesa or a big landform that was made by weathering and erosion. The face of the rock is most likely just shadows from the camera angle and the sun. And another thing, when the camera passed over the mesa, it was a cloudy and rainy day, making the camera lens wet.

I think that the rock is a mesa. The proof is in the article and it would have been noticed in the pictures if there was aliens living on Mars. So the non-alien side wins this argument over this one. The rock is not a face it is a normal rock.",392
262,0,1,0.9998524188995361,0.00014753485447727144,"With the majority of people owning and using a cell phone daily, often times these people use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. This act can put not only the driver but other people's safety at risk. Humans should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Using a cell phone while operating a vehicle can cause a person to be distracted and their focus to be shifted from the road to their device. If a vehicle is driving at sixty miles per hour, a second of distracting phone usage can cause the driver to miss hundreds of feet ahead of them leaving them vulnerable to any possible accidents in front of them. This is a danger to not only the driver but to any other drivers on the road and can lead to unnecessary injuries. Banning any phone usage while driving will greatly decrease the amount of injuries and deaths due to automobile accidents.

There are already many efforts from both phone and car manufacturers to try and help the problem of phone usage while driving. Phone companies have started to implement different apps that can turn phone notifications off while a person is driving. Such as Apple with Do Not Disturb While Driving that tracks when you are driving and blocks all calls, texts and other notifications. Car manufacturers also do not let drivers pair their phone to the car bluetooth while the car is driving. Both phone and car manufacturers have recognized that it is dangerous when people operate both in conjunction and are trying to save lives.",268

Limiting car usage has several very influential advantages, such as increasing mental health, reducing air pollution, and eliminating problems associated with traffic.

First of all, studies have proven that the use of automobiles is linked to the levels of stress and unhappiness that people feel. Source one elaborates on this by discussing a city in Germany that decided to give up cars. It quotes a woman who says that when she had a car she was always tense, but living in Vauban (the car- free city) has made her much happier. She is able to walk or bike everywhere that she needs to be in town. This opportunity to increase happiness is also mentioned in source three, which quotes a businessman who says that limiting car usage is ""a good opportunity to take away stress."" The alternative he choses is to ride a tandem bike with his wife. This allows for more bonding with his wife as well as increasing their physical health, which plays a vital role in mental health as well.

As of recently, the impact that cars have on the enviroment has gained more attention as well as increased concern. All vehicles emit greenhouse gasses, which are very harmful to the enviroment, causing smog and damage to the atmosphere. According to source one, limiting the use of passenger cars could reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50 percent. Source two describes how the accumulation of smog in Paris became so bad that it caused official bans on the use of cars. It took an entire week of restricting car usage to get the smog to clear up. Source four also agrees that the results of limiting car usage would have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment. Source one mentions that as a result of all of this, the Enviromental Protection Agency in the United States is promoting car reduced communities.

Lastly, limiting car usage eliminates all problems associated with traffic. Traffic creates many problems for people, from increasing danger to wasting time. Limiting car usage would immidately reduce traffic substantially. This could prevent people from being stuck on their way home during rush-hour every day.  Having cars speeding by, in residential areas especially, increases the level of danger for pedestrians. There are many casualties that happen every year due to automobile accidents. Limiting car usage would easily eliminate this problem. It would also eliminate the problem of drunk driving and the dangers associated with it. Source four supports this claim by stating that limiting car usage would in fact improve safety.

Limiting car usage has many advantages, and therefore should definately be taken into consideration. Doing this would not only increase mental health and wellbeing, but would also save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety.",520

In my opinion, I agree with this quote because, if you do not try to do better everyday, you are not going to reach your purpose. When you have the experience, on doing something you have to keep doing it, and you will improve each day. If you keep working on something that you have already work on it, and you don't stop focused on, it will make you grow. The more things you learn the more prepared you will be in your life.

My first reason that support my response, is that if you don't keep trying to do better everyday, you are not going to complete your goal. If you keep trying your best and doing what you like to do you will grow each day. Its important that you try your best everyday not only you will grow in your life but you are going to make yourself proud as well. For example, some people have their goals but they don't try their best.

My second reason that support my response is that when you have the experience on doing something you most keep doing it, and you will improve each day. Every time you try to improve, its a good opportunity for you to grow. The experience you have will make your future better. If you work on something that you have already work on it, and you don't stop focused on it will make your life easier. The more you work on something the fastest you will see the different in your life. For example, in my experience every time I know how to do something and I keep practicing, on it I get to improve myself.

My third reason that support my response is that the more things you learn the more prepared your will be in your life. If you try to learn more things and not just stay focused in just one thing will make you to be able to grow. Everyday you most have the purpose of learning new things. Learning new things each day, makes a person specialized and all the things you know. For example, in my experience when I try to learn more about something, its easier for me to talk about it.

To conclude, I agree with the author Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement. The more you know about something, the best future you will have. If you focused on doing good everyday you will grow. Trying to do something you have experience with will make you grow. Working on your purpose will make you have a better life.",447
369,0,1,0.9999334812164307,6.652802403550595e-05,"The idea of using facial recognition technology to identify how someone is feeling is a new one. It is also a preposturous one. You cannot fully understand what someone is feeling by looking at their face, and attempting to do so is an invasion of their privacy. Facial action coding systems should not be used in classrooms.

The idea that you could fully decipher what someone is feeling based on how they look is absurd. You cannot decide for yourself how someone feels based on the movement of their muscles. For example, if someone looks sad, you cannot just decide that they are sad, just because they look that way. If a machine decides I look confused, does it really have the right to change what I am learning? To understand how someone is really feeling, you have to first ask yourself why they might be feeling that way. Once you understand this, then you can determine what is happening. A machine cannot read minds. If I am confused about one thing, the machine does not know what. Not to mention that people often feel varying emotions at varying times of the day. I might be sad one minute, then laugh at a joke the next. I might not understand something, than understand it in the next second. The machine might automatically change something I understood based on a few seconds of confusion. This is not efficient or helpful.

To read someone's emotions based on their facial expressions is an invasion of their privacy. Let's assume this machine can accurately decipher someone's emotions based on muscle movement. What if you don't want people to know how you're feeling? If I am confused about something, and I am embarrased about it, suddenly the whole word knows. It should be up to the student to decide whether or not they want to seek help, not some magical machine. By forcing students to share private emotions, you run the risk of making them less willing to go to school. Who would want to go to a school where everyone knows how you feel at all times of the day? That would affect learning severely, and would definitely do more harm than good. Hindering learning in an attempt to better understand students is not worth it.

Using this software in classrooms would be ineffective, and even if it did work, it would be a huge invasion of privacy. This software should be used on paintings and nothing more. It is not accurate enough to do anything other than hold back human learning. This software is not fit for classrooms.",435

Wouldn`t it be exciting for a student to create a summer projects for their fellow students to do during summer break? Summer break is a time for students to have fun with their families and friends. It a time to travel to so many places like Generic_City, Florida, California, and so forth. Furthermore, it`s great for students to complete summer projects during their break so their brains and memories can still be refreshed and for them not to forget most of the school materials they have learned before summer break. Moreover, requiring students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break is a brilliant idea. But these summer projects should be student-designed because the projects will be exciting, students will be more engaged with the projects, and the student-designed projects will definitely be less harder.

The first reason the summer projects should be a student-designed is because the projects will be exciting and enjoyable for other students. For example, when a students designs a Kahoot for their fellow students to use to study for their test and quizzes, it will be exciting just because the students will get to choose any names they wish. So, a Kahoot is a game that teachers use to create a test or quizzes for students to study to get them prepared for their test and quizzes. The Kahoot can be used inside and outside of the school premises. The student designing the kahoot will get to choose how many seconds or minutes it should take the students to answer their questions. Also, most teachers don`t give students enough time for them to choose their answers and that is unfair. Students needs more time at least 20 to 30 seconds to think about the questions before answering and not rush to choose any answer just because the teacher didn`t give them enough time. Students complain about how much time teachers give them because they need more time to work on their projects. For instance, teachers design boring projects like making a word puzzel about math. That is so boring because no students wants to spend their time making a word puzzle about math instead of doing other fun things like reading, going to the movie theater, going on vacation, and spending time with their families and friends. Most of the students don`t find math interesting beccause they don`t like doing math.

Another reason is that students will be more engaged with the projects. For instance, a student designed a project about each students choosing their own topic argumentative essay like increasing the minimum wage, the college tuition, and discrimination. After that, the student will design another projects about presentations. The presentation will teach them how to present to their fellow students and also how to present in future times like jobs. The presentation will also help them master the skills of presenting. When a student designs the projects, the student will give the students extra time to work on it because teachers will give students less time on their project and expect the students to be prepared when they are not. Furthermore, the students will decide if they need to present to teachers because most students are nervous to do that. And also they have not mastered the skill of presenting yet. The students will also decide how many words will be in each slides, how many slides they need, and how many minutes they need to present. Most of the times, teachers give students less time to present. Due to the less time, students won`t be able to finish what they have in mind or what they have to say and they will have to be rushed to finish before time is over. And if the students didn`t reach the time given or went over the time given, points will be deducted. But when the students chooses how they want their presentations to be, they are more likely to work on it more than when a teacher tells them how to do their own presentations.

The third reason is because the student-designed project will be less harder for students to do. For example, there was a project my history teacher assigned us to do, it was a project about the Progressive Era to make sure that we understand what it was all about. We had to come up with a creative title and 3 categories for the project. It was hard for us to do because we had to come up with a creative title that connects with the topic and 3 categories that 20 sub-heading can fit on one of them. If it was a student designed the project, it would be less harder because either the title is given to us, or we don`t have to create one. And also the 3 categories will be given to use to make it a little more easier. Then all we have to do is put the 20 sub-heading in their right categories and also insert some images where it suppose to be. Another example was when my AVID teacher gave a project about researching the college of our choice. It`s great that we had to choose the college of our choice, but the questions and the rubric was unclear. They were almost the same question and it was difficult for us to answer it because we couldn`t give the same answer to all the questions. Even though some people say that teacher-designed will be so much better because students will tend to take it seriously than a student-designed; however, student-designed is better because its made by a student and it will less stressful, while teacher-designed will be a lot harder and frustrating to do.

In conclusion, student-designed is better because its more fun, engaging, and easier to do than teacher-designed. Students need more time towork on their projects while spending time with families and friends. It`s great to have fun while learning and not stress out over a project during summer break. Schools need to give students an opportunities for them to design a projects for their follow students, and to show their skills and talents. ",1027

Mr. Plumer stated, ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" While it is somewhat unfair and outdated, the electoral college is needed in a sense of today's society. Everytime someone who is African American is murdered or killed, people always think it's a racial matter. Take a look at the incidents that were going on in Ferguson. Michael Brown, an African American teenager, was shot and killed by an officer, who was a white man. The people of Ferguson were literally rioting in the streets over a matter of a cop defending himself. So if that kind of society were to directly vote for our next president, it would be extremely biased. If another African American were to run for president of the United States, most Blacks would vote for him and say things like, ""If he doesn't win presidency, then this country is racist!"" To me, that's how American society is and that's why we should keep the electoral college.

In addition, the electoral college is needed to keep balance and fairness among the country. If there was no electoral college, and the votes came straight from the people, there would be problems regarding the states and the population of those states. For example, California would have a huge advantage at deciding who the next president is over a small state like Maryland. The electoral college is meant to keep balance among most, if not all, the states.

Another reason to keep the electoral college is that it requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, according to Mr. Posner. He states, ""No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. If there was no electoral college, the votes would heavily swing one way or the other, because of regional culture. People in the South would generally vote for someone who is white and Republican, where as the North, or states like Florida and California would vote for someone who is democratic, and since race is a exponentially large matter in today's society, people who are African American would vote for the runnning candidate who is African American or of black descent.

A vote straight from the people could work if racial perspective wasn't a huge factor like it has been since the civil rights movement. But right now, this country needs an electoral college because without one, votes would be based on race, state size, and culture.",428

First, in my case if I see a beautiful girl, I start getting in love of that girl and having good impression about her, but may be I see something wrong that i don't like of her, I start changing my good impression that i had of her.

Second, when somebody watch YouTube videos, then that person person watch a publicity about the new amazing iPhone 11, he has good impression about the amazing iPhone 11, but when he buys the iPhone, he looks that the battery is not that good as he thought, so he change his opinion.

Third when I go to fancy restaurants, I see a lot of delicious food coming throw the tables, I have good impression and expectation about the restaurant, and I think that the food is delicious, but when I try to eat one of those plates, the food was disgusting and it didn't taste that delicious as it looks,that's because my impression change totally.

Phones and driving is a really big problem in today's society. There are many arguments' related to this topic. One of the major arguments is if drivers should or should not be able to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. We all have our different thoughts and opinions related to this topic. I personally think people shouldn't be able to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. There are many reasons why I say this

It is very dangerous to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. There have been many cases where people get in accidents or die or even kill someone else because of cell phone distraction. Day by day there are accidents, majority of the time is because drivers are distracted and not focused in driving safely and checking their surroundings. Cell phones are now a part of our everyday life and as well as our vehicles. We can't get distracted so easily with our cell phones when we are trying to get from one place to another using a vehicle. People should always be cautious when operating a vehicle regardless if using a phone or not.

In addition to this, drivers should really only use their phones for navigation only if they are heading to a place they don't know of. Our phones have a GPS and it helps us get from one place to another and I feel like that should only be the reason why we use our phones while operating a vehicle. This will help drivers stay focused and away from any other distractions. I believe that drivers should be aware that a call or a text can wait, and if it's a serious emergency they should pull over before risking a chance to have an accident or possibly kill themselves or someone else. Being safe is the first thing drivers should have in mind before and while operating a vehicle.

Furthermore, there are drivers with a lot of experience in driving. Many people think they are good drivers but accidents can happen to anyone. Many teens start driving at an early age. According to the AAA the percentage of teens that acknowledge the risk of cell phone, use while driving is 94%. Although this is the case 35% of those teens admitted of doing it anyway. In addition, teen drivers are four times more likely to get into car crashes than adults because of cell phone use. They both have a risk and an accident can happen to anyone.

Finally, I believe that every driver should always be cautious and have in mind the risk there is when it comes to driving. In general, driving can be very dangerous and especially if you are distracted with your phone. Distractions can easily cause an accident at any time and moment. There is always going to be danger on the road regardless how good of a driver you are. I think drivers can wait a few minutes to reply to a text instead of causing a tragedy and never ever be able to reply to another text message. Cell phones are in our everyday use as well as our vehicles, it is better to see an everyday rather than to distract yourself today and not see tomorrow. This is why I believe drivers should not be able to use their phone while operating a vehicle.",568
790,0,1,0.9999357461929321,6.420231511583552e-05,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage helps to cleanse the environment, saves citizens money, and can help with improving citizens health.

One advantage to limiting car usage is that it will cleanse the environment. Cars give off a number of gallons of gas each time they're used. These toxic chemicals found in gases pollute the air. Imagine breathing in all of that waste! Studies have actually found evidence that the toxins from car fuel are very harmful to the health of animals, plants, and humans. It can cause breathing difficulties associated with problems in the lungs when inhaled too heavily as well as it dirties plants and makes it more difficult for them to grow healthy, like they should, and it can even poison and kill the animals. Who wants to take a risk so deadly?

Another advantage to limiting car usage is that it will save citizens money. Cars aren't cheap. Depending on the make and model of the car, they can cost anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000. Insurance and keeping up with the maintenance of a car also costs a lot. Car owners should be expecting to pay 100500 a month for car maintence, and if insurance is required, depending on the state that the car owner lives in, than another additional 100. Finally, is the price for gas. The price for gas in this day in age economy ranges from 3.006.00 per gallon! If a car owner has a long way to drive, but doesn't have a lot of money, heshe may want to consider taking a bus or carpooling with someone to help them out.

A rather more humorous advantage to limiting car usage, is that it could help give citizens a work out. Instead of driving where they need to go, people could walk to their desired destination and burn a ton of calories while doing it! Or in contrast to waiting for a friend to pick them up outside their houses, they could walk to a bus stop and wait for the bus to take them wherever they need to go. This also relates to saving money and helping cleanse the environment. Citizens' will pay less for a gym membership now that they're getting a work out. They'll also be helping the environment by not burning all of those fuel wastes just to get to where they need to go. It's a winwin for everyone!

Of course, there are many advantages to limiting car usage for our citizens, their wallets, and the environment. These three are just a few of the plentiful, conservative ways out there however, they're all extroardinarily efficient.",442

Although, it may seem that trying is hard and it's a waste of time, it is actually true that trying can make you achieve your goals.

Trying my hardest showed me who I really am. I accomplished some of my goals, but I always try to be inspired. This helped me get through my problems. None of my goals have been easy, they're hard, but that doesn't stop me. My plan is to be successful in life and not to be a failure. Sometimes I loose and sometimes I win.

I used to be 275 pounds, I wasn't happy with the way I looked. I also experience random pain in my heart. My body was telling me to start loosing weight. I really wanted to go and loose all of my weight, but my lazy side said to just sit in the couch and play video games all day. I had to get my life together and started going to the gym, the following day. Day by day, I started to feel something different. I felt more energetic and strong. I ate healthy and those heart pains were gone. My parents were always there for me to encourage me. I also wanted to be an example to my little brother that anything is possible, as long as you try.

I lost 58 pounds to be exact. I feel lighter than ever. I went beyond my limits to accomplish my goal. All hard work always rewards you as it did for me. My reward was having cheat days. I always love cheat days because you can forget about your diet for a day and eat whatever you want. Cheat days are the best to have, but not all the time. You can loose track and fall.

Accomplishments are hard to achieve, but it's a lot of fun to do them. They can make you a better person and makes your life so much easier. As long as you try your best, you can do anything.

While driving you must be sure that your taking every precaution you can to maintain safety for yourself and others as well. Many people believe that the use of cell phones can be very hazardous, and I strongly agree with that statement for many reasons. Cell phones have caused fatal wrecks that lead to either death or serious injury. For example, ""an article published by Tony Long states that he was almost killed on his motorcycle while trying to avoid being hit by a reckless driver who was on the phone."" The use of cell phones while operating a vehicle isn't the most ideal or realistic to ensure your safety as well as others safety.

Cell phones cause late reactions, especially for those that are being held in the driver's hand. Majority of people have a habit of allowing their cell phone to influence their reflexes and reactions to certain death-defying situations. One of my resources states, ""Not only are 27 percent of all automobile accidents believed to result from talking or texting while driving, but smartphone use has also been implicated in several recent rail disasters as well."" The use of cell phones while driving a vehicle is just as dangerous as drunk driving, maybe even worse because studies shown that, ""texting and driving slows the reaction time more than being drunk"". Meaning that using a phone while under the wheel can alter a driver's reaction time on the road because your focusing on two things at once, although all your attention should be towards driving and driving only.

Even a two-second distraction - taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example- increases your risk of crashing. The National Safety Council reports that, ""answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field."" Anything can happen while you're driving, such as: a car could hit their brakes in front of you, a car could be merging into your lane, traffic might be coming up, or something might jump out into the road. Therefore, you need to keep your eyes on the road at all times with your hands free of anything other than the steering wheel.

It is statistically proven that the cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes with nearly 390,000 injuries each year. Even with those high numbers, people still choose to be on a cell phone while managing with a vehicle on the road. Some people believe that it is safe to use a phone while driving, or that ""nothing will happen to them"". In 2017, there were 34,247 distracted driving accidents and 15,341 that were aged between 15 and 29 were involved in fatal crashes while driving with a cell phone in hand. Therefore, some people may believe that using a cell phone while driving isn't dangerous, but the facts say otherwise.

In conclusion, don't operate a vehicle while using a phone at the same time because it can lead to some serious consequences. You are not only endangering yourself but your endangering others on the road, as well as passengers, or even any close-by pedestrians. Driving needs complete attention and focus so ensure the risk of any injuries or deaths because driving is very dangerous. Using a cell phone takes away your focus and attention from driving because now you're trying to multi-task which means you're playing with life or lives. Speaking from experience, cell phones should be banned while driving because they slow your reaction time to anything that may be happening around you. Managing a cell phone while driving is now putting you in a life or death situation that you wouldn't want to be put in.",651

Does this mean that his argument is perfect? No. With all this said, I have come to the conclusion that the author has the sufficient evidence to support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, despite the dangers.

First, I would like to address his argumentative claim: studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author is simply saying we should explore Venus. The author is not implying every human being should live on Venus right now. Exploring Venus could be dangerous, but the good outweighs the bad when taking into consideration the advances we could make.

The article says, ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus."" The author uses this throughout the article to illustrate that NASA wants to explore Venus. NASA/scientists would not discuss even visiting the surface if it was not a possibility. The author wants to show the audience that it is a worthy and possible pursuit. The author knows the dangers and even expresses them throughout the article. He/she is not trying to hide the fact that their are dangers involved in exploring Venus. The main argumentative point made by the author is the fact that Venus is the closest planet to being exactly like Earth. The article says, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" Venus is the closest we can get to the planet we are living on now. The author describes the advances we could get from astronaunts touching down on Venus and exploring. Venus could have been just like Earth, but one will never know until humankind touches its surface. The conditions are not easy, but we will not be able to find out if humans can live there until we study Venus.

In conclusion, one can see the author's suggestion as absurd or one could see possiblility/advancements for humans. I see possibilities in studying/exploring Venus. The author should not have included as much research against his claim that he did and I can understand the opposing sides claim, but I also believe the author illustrated the room for advances. Although I know the dangers presented in this article, the author was still able to convince me otherwise.",398

Seeking advice in the first place can give you a different view on the problem you are trying to solve. But seeking multiple opinions will give you perspectives from all angles. Thus, you will know how it will affect you and other people. Seeking advice from people can also tell you what not to do. If they have been in that same situation before, they can tell you what worked and what didn't work for them. This could give you an idea of what you should try and what you shouldn't try. Seeking opinions helps people make better choices.

For example, if Generic_Name wanted to know how she was going to build a bridge, she wouldn't just consult herself. This would leave out input and opinions from other people. She would consult with other people. She would consult with engineers, the community, pedestrians, and environmentalists for opinions. She would consult with an engineer so she would know what made up a sturdy bridge. She would consult with the community because they would be the ones driving over the bridge. They would also help her decide how many lanes would be on the bridge. She would also consult pedestrians because if they wanted to walk over the bridge, there should be a special walkway so they don't get run over. And lastly, she would consult environmentalists so she would have the least amount of impact on animal habitats and wildlife. In order to fully understand building a bridge, she would have to consult with many different people. After concerns were brought up, she would try to attack them from all angles. It would be easier on her because she would know the concerns of the community and how it will affect them. After talking with the engineer, she would know a sturdy design and to implement it she would need advice of a construction company. After Generic_Name is done building the bridge, she will be very knowledgeable because she consulted with so many different groups and parties.

Thus, seeking advice can help you make better decisions. It can give you multiple perspectives on the problem. Then you will know how to attack the focus from all angles. It will also give you good advice on what works. Seeking advice can help people make better choices.",401

There is not to much evidence leaning either way, but I feel that it leans more twards being natural. We have not landed and investigated it yet. I have some evidence to support my idea. After reading this essay, I am sure that you will understand my point of view.

I belive that the face of mars is natural. First, It is just a large rock formation that could have just occured naturally. Second, There is no other sign of life on mars. Third, It only resembles a face, it is not perfect. It is still controversial because we cannot examin it face to face. We only have the images that the space shuttles took from 1976 through 2001. Just because it is a formation on a different planet, it doesn't mean it was created by aliens.

When God created the universe, did He say that He created little green men to live on the different planet? No. He said that the only intelligent being, with His breath in our lungs, that he created was use. Although, He did say He created the wonders of this universe. I would call the face a wonder, wouldn't you? God created one planet with the perfect design for life, and that planet is our home Earth.

Teachers would know if the students are understanding the lessons. Teachers could know if students are stressing and help them calm down. The software would help provide better data for researchers. The program would benefit both students and teachers. It would also make getting data for research easier.

With the use of the new software, schools can provide a better learning environment. The program can tell people how the students respond to lessons and how they are taught. Teachers can take this information and use it to better their classrooms. They can make their lessons more interactive and fun. The software would allow for more labs to be performed in science classes. It might inspire students to go into science fields if they enjoy the F.A.C.S.

The technology could help teachers recognize struggling students. Many students will not say that they need help, even if they do. Teachers may be able to help brighten a student's day, so they do not spend the rest being sad. This could help prevent school ""accidents"" and keep the school's environment ""happier."" The F.A.C.S could help teachers know when the students need a minute's break to help them refocus.

The software could help researchers collect better data faster. Researchers would not need to go to schools to collect information. They could just take it from the program directly.

It could also alert people to dangers in the classrooms by detecting whenever students are scared.

1592,0,1,0.9998347759246826,0.00016516495088580996,"Why does NASA consider the ""Face of Mars"" to be a natural landform? They claim that the ""face"" is the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa. There are multiple points of evidence that support this claim.

Firstly, NASA has traveled to the location multiple times, and photographed it extensively. In the passage, it is stated that NASA sent two different spacecraft to photograph the formation three different times. While Viking I's camera appears to capture a face-like structure, this is not the case. In the passage, it is said that to confirm that this was a natural occurence, NASA sent the Mars Global surveyor to capture another image. This image was much sharper, and appeared to favor the idea that the site was natural. Some people were not satisified due to a claimed ""haze"" that hid the structure during the cloudy, windy period on Mars. The Global Surveyor was sent back a second time, and this time, it captured clear, still images that are at the absolute maximum resolution. (About 1.5 meters per pixel.) This was more than enough to capture an image of any structures on the site, but none were found.

In addition, NASA has no reason to keep the public misinformed about the so-called ""alien face."" Quite the opposite actually, as NASA would benefit immensely from the funds that could be acquired using the publicity. If there was conclusive evidence supporting the claim the ""alien face"" was a monument constructed by ancient Martian civilizations and not just a natural formation on the planet, NASA would advertise the claim and it's evidence in an attempt to receive more funding.

On the other hand, I can see how some people could be fooled into believing that there was once a civilization on Mars. In the passage, NASA uses a caption that says the structure ""resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

However, now that NASA has investigated the site and taken multiple photos confirming the site as a rock formation, the structure should be regarded as a regular Martian mesa that posseses an uncanny resemblance to a human face.

In conclusion, the ""Face of Mars"" has been proven to be little more than a large rock formation that simply bore an unnatural resemblance to a human face. The belief that it is otherwise a structure of ancient alien origin is unsubstantiated and incorrect.",403

In the story, ""The challenging of Explopring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying venus is indeed a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author uses many reasons and example to support this idea. At the beginning of the story, the author states, ""While venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.""

In paragraph 2, it talks about how Venus is one of the closest planets to earth by size and density. Earth, Venus and mars are the three planets that are the closest to the sun and orbit around the sun at different speeds. Since we have differences in speed, it sometimes causes us, Earth, to be closer to Mars and other times Closer to Venus.

Because of this closesness, humans have sent spacecrafts out to land on this planet, but no one has succeeded in three decades, according to paragraph 2 of the article. They believe this is because of the speed it moves at different points. Venus also has some very dangerous features that makes it even more harder for this planet to be explored.

In the third paragraph of the article is where the features of venus comes in. This planet is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. which is not very good for humans to be around. Also, the clouds of Venus are highly consisted of sulfuric acid. The average temperature on venus is over 800 degrees Farenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times gretaer then what we exoerience on Earth. A human would have a hard time survivng in this type of temperature. For example, in paragraph 2 it states, "" Such an environment would crush even a submarine customed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.""

It takes a lot of heat to liquefy a metal on Earth, so the fact that Venus can do this with no problem, shows that a human would not survive the heat on Venus. Not even for a day. It is said that Venus does indeed have the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system.

It is said that, even though Venus has these dangerous features, there are reasons why scientist still believe in studying this planet.

In paragraph 4 it says theat the reason Astronomers are fascianted by Venus is because once upon a time, it was the most Earth like planet in our solar system. A while back, it was said to be covered with oceans and could of have forms of life living on it, just like Earth. ""Today Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth,"" according to paragraph 4. It has a surface of rocky sediment and familiar features such as valleys, moutains and craters. These are reason why an astronomer would still want to study Venus.

Also, despite the dangers, the NASA believes there is one way to send humans to study Venus. That is for the scientist to float over the fray of venus, to avoid a good amount of heat from Venus.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why we shouldn't study venus and why it is a bad idea to send people to Venus, but there are features on Venus that make astronomers and scientist want to explore. Such as the features it has similar to Earth. In spite of this, Scientient are working on new ways that will help them get closer to Venus. For example, ""Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbon dioxide have been tested in a chamber stimulating the chaos od Venus's surafec and have lasted for three weeks."" Which is actually good considering all the carbon dioxide on Venus. They have also been developing new forms of mechanical computers.

These are thing scientist and astronomers are doing just to be able to study Venus because this is what they value. In my opinion, they see this as a challenge and they are working and coming up with ways to accomplish this challenge. In paragraph 8, it states, "" Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value , not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This is basically saying that they don't want to just explore it because of the sights. the dangers and doubts are what push them to explore it more because they believe something like this shouldn't stop them from their travels beyond Earth.",795

I believe students should participate in extracurricular activities because one it keep them out of trouble, two some of the activities keep them healthy, and three they are fun.

One reason students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they keep most students out of trouble. For example, it can keep the students occupied so they don't have to be on the streets. Another example is sometimes these activities can help them relax and keep them calm so they stay out of trouble.

Another reason is some of the activities can keep them healthy. For example students can do football or basketball which keeps them running and keeps them in good shape. They can also do lift training after school which keep them fit and all around healthy.

Last but not least these activities are fun. There are always a lot of activities and you can always find something you like. For example if you like sports there are so many different sports you can do. There are also other things like drama club if you like acting, art club if you like drawing, even robotics club if you like technology and stuff like that.

Therefore these are the reasons I agree that all students should do at least one extracurricular activity.",218

The benefits of optimism extend beyond stress relief better health, more rewarding relationships and enhanced productivity. People with a positive outlook tend to experience are reduced incidence of depression, lower stress levels and are better able to cope with stress causing events, an incresed life span and overall better health. People with a positive outlook on life are also more likely to live healthier lifestyle, and to smoke cigarattes less and drink less alcohol.

Attitude is the way taht we behave and we react to the daily activities, consequently a positive attitude may influence our life and it aspects in a deep way such as how we think, socialize, and even how our health is. All these aspects might be affected by a positive attitude. Actually it is proved that successful people have been influenced by the way they see the circumtances in their life. In other words, successful people see those circumtances with a positive attitude and they see those circumtances as a challange to beat and not like a punishment to suffer. Therefore, these people will be more likely to fight and have success in their life, rather than the ones who see their life as a punishment. Positive attitude might be the key to all the people who want to fulfill their dreams. If everyone would apply these concepts in their lives, they would become happier because they will see that everything including their life, situations, and problems, is under their own control.

Even though there are some people who wonder how to get a good positive attitude, is not simple to get it. Almost every single person that has has a positive attitude is because tehy have had a motivation or a feeling that supports their fight to reach their goal or achievement. When you have a positive attitude, you feel that there is a power inside of you that motivates you to do something or to get involved with something. These people are most commons to have best attitudes of this world.

Having a positive attitude can lead you to the lighter, braver and stronger way to stand against negative attitude.          ",400

The question is whether this technology is actually valuable and for what it could be used for. Experts suggest this technology could be used in a classroom to identify the state of mind of a student to adjust the lesson they are trying to comprehend. But, even though this technology may be helpful to teachers trying to keep students active and engrossed in their lessons, the question arises of whether this techonlogy is actually worth the recources or whether what experts think is a great idea is actually an invasion of privacy.

This technology does sound helpful in the fact that it could gauge the state of mind of a student and help a teacher adjust their teaching methods to accomodate and keep their students students on track. The article did state that the techonology could identify when a student is ""confused or bored"" and then ""modify the lesson"" to keep a student engaged. In this way, the technology is useful in the fact that it adapts to the needs of the student. But what can this program do that a teacher's survey could not? By the way the article talks about how a ""home PC can't handle the complex algorithms"" and about how complex the system is, it makes people wonder just how much this system would cost and how complicated it would be to enstate said system into a classroom. Compared to a quick survey done by a teacher who asks their students how they feel about their methods of teaching, it is seen how the system would be a waste of recourses and money. Therefore, although this system is useful in the fact that it can gauge the emotions of the students, it is not much more useful than a teacher who can do the same thing by questioning their students on their preferences and ideas.

Also, although technology is very much improved in these years, it is still not always accurate and infallible, and therefore may not be suitable for a classroom. The article states that the technology associates each emotion with ""characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a ""false smile"", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.

Lastly, if the physical problems of the technology have not already been offputting, then maybe the moral problem of this technology will sway opinions against using it in a classroom. If this technology really can ""indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"", then this means it can invade people's privacy and indicate an emotion which a person is trying to hide. If a student is feeling sad or feeling stressed about home problems which they are trying to conceal, then the technology detects this and displays it for the teacher and the electronic lesson to see. This is an invasion of privacy, as the teacher does not need to know about a student's homelife or about their feelings outside the classroom. A teachers job should be to monitor how their students are feeling about their lessons, not about how their students are feeling about their life outside of school, and since this technology could pick up on digressing feelings, it should not be used in a classroom where a student's internal feelings are revealed to a teacher. Therefore, using Facial Action Coding could end up being an invasion of privacy that should not be introduced to the classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System is a bad idea for the classroom, as it could incorrectly read a student's emotions and give a misleading output that puts a student off track in their education, and also because it could invade a student's privacy of their inner mind. Therefore, installing this system in schools would be a waste of money and recourses, especially when teachers can gauge how their students are learning by simply asking their students in an anonymous survey how they feel about their teaching methods. In this society, technology is used to fix almost everything, but in this case, scientists should quit trying to force technology on behavioral issues and just let humans interact so they can benefit themselves with communication, no computerized middleman needed.",935

Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. I strongly disagree with this prompt because once we enter high school we are transitioning to a bigger school with more new subjects that catches our attention. My reasons for disagreeing is that I was once a rising ninth grader and I would be unhappy with the career I wanted in my freshman year. For example when I first came into high school as a ninth grader I wasn't sure of what I wanted to be once I graduate. Now I am a senior at Generic_school and I have two option to choose from.

In my perspective I believe that at a young age mindset changes; you find new interest in things and also our mind isn't fully developed at ages fourteen or fifth teen; we aren't mature wisely on what we want. I think the student should started preparing them self once they're in junior year which is when they're a eleventh grader. My reason for saying that is because you're close to graduating and need to start planning your future, looking for scholarship, and making sure you want the career you've chosen for a long period of time.

I don't think its a bad idea but i wouldn't agree with it because I know how this generation is like and we need more teacher to start talking to them seriously about life after high school. These past year a huge amount of student have dropped out of school because they do not feel like they have support from teacher, friends, or even their own parents; or maybe the student think they can't afford college; not many teacher talk to them about financial help or support.",310
2232,0,1,0.9925246834754944,0.0074753290973603725,"Dear Mr. Senator:

Lately there's been a problem regarding electoral colleges. Some people are in favor of them; others not so much. I agree with the latter; electoral colleges are anachronistic and should no longer be used in this day and age.

In this modern era, people are being more aware or more educated about the going-ons in government. As a result, it is becoming no longer necessary to have others vote in place of the people's choices. Instead, people should be able to vote directly for their chosen leaders and not have to worry about an elector making a last minute decision to vote for another.

Those who are in favor of electoral colleges are wrong about keeping them. In only half-way allowing people to vote for president, it could also be viewed that the people were never really given a choice. Their votes are at the mercy of the electors.

If you are wise Mr. Senator, you'll choose to do away with electoral colleges. By doing so, you give people more choice and control over their decisions. I hope you'll put your foot down on this matter and refuse to have anything to do with electoral colleges because they're not helping the future of our country,

2424,0,1,0.9998494386672974,0.00015048070054035634,"Dear Senator PROPER_NAME, The purpose of this letter is to fight for the cause of removing the Electoral College and voting simply by popular vote. With evidence from ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" by Richard A. Ponser, I will elaborate on this subject. Now, since I am only fourteen, I do not claim to have all knowledge and be an expert on this method of voting, but it is not the way to choose our country's leader.

The Electoral College is a compromise between who the people of America chose and who Congress has chosen. This is an incorrect method of selecting the President. The Constitution states that we the people have the choice to select our government not Congress. Yes, the constitutions founding fathers also established the Electoral College, but it is a thing of the past. As Richard A. Ponser writes, an ""anchorism"" In Defense of the Electoral College, par. 1, if you will. Moreover, the Electoral College does not belong in this day and age it is something that is outdated and in need of replacement.

The Electoral College also does not allow citizens to exercise their right to vote for their President, since Congress also has their say in the matter. The voting process was created for the citizens not the people who are in the government. In fact, Bradford Plumer states that ""over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" The Indefensible Electoral College, par. 1 This process of voting for President is undesired and despised my many people, by over half of the voters in America. The Office of the Federal Register writes that the Electoral College is ""a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by popular vote of qualified citizens."" Why does Congress have any sort of influence or say in this matter? The people choose their government not the governemt itself!

Alright, the Electoral College is something that should not be used, by I can see the point of its purpose. The popular vote of the citizens can be infulenced by others, or advertisements and propoganda from political parties. Some voters are biased and overlook the negative things of the candidates because they do not wish to believe that this person does not support or believe everything they do. The Electoral College helps to balance that out. ""No region... has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" In Defense of the Electoral College, par. 5 Richard A. Ponser asserts this in his article, as well as the fact that no region or place has any reason to go about ""increasing his plurality"" par. 5 to make sure that a candidate will win. The Electoral College prevents this, resulting in a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and Congress.

To come to a conclusion, I have stated that the Electoral College is not a method that should be used to choose the President of the United States. It is outdated and does not allow citizens to choose the leader of their country. However, is balances out the popular vote and the Congress's vote.

To begin with, this could be used to ditermine the hidden human emotions. For instance, when I am having a presentation about a specefic topic, but I cannot know the audence's true feelings against me because people usually flatter and do not show their real thoughts. However, by using this technology, I can figure out if mine was good enough or not from the data.

In other hand, I believe this has to be limited to protect individual human rights. For example, what if I could read emotions that are shown by folks, they would be bewildered because they have their own private feelings. This might become a big and grave issue later.

As a conclusion, technology is much smarter and more intellegent, but does not have abilities to control human rights. Just because that can decearn the emotion rate, does not mean that can know the real problem beyond this technology.",172

In the realm of arguing weather the use of emotional recognition technology should be used in a classroom can be a very difficult tquestion. On one side, you can say it may invade privacy, but on the other hand, it could help teachers see if students are understanding the topic. The question still lies on which one is more important for both the student and the teacher. In my opinion, this technology should be implemented into classrooms internationally because it will help students learn more effectivley, but also it will enhance the teachers teaching ability when they know where they're students are going array.

This technology could be very benificial for students across the globe. The ability for a piece of technology to understand your emotions could come in handy. There are many outgoing students, but there are also many introverted students. Some students may not feel confident enough to ask for something to be repeated, so they may simply sit at their desks puzzeled for the rest of the class, while a simple question could've avoided this. If this technology is instituted, it will automatically know when a student isn't confident on the information and alert the teacher. By doing this, the introverted student won't be confused for very long and the topic could be revisited without the student to have to personally ask. It not only will help introverted students, but students across the board. Every student will benifit form this technology and will display in their grades. With this technology, the students acedemic achievements will expand exponentially. Becuase of this ability for teachers to understand their emotions, the quick turn around of revisiting the topic and teaching it a little differently could help the students absorb all the information, especially the information that they mau have not conprehended initally. This technology will be very valuable for the students for both their enjoyment throughout school becuase of the reduced stress, and their improvents in acedemic grades.

This technology is not only bennifical to the students, but to the teacher as well. For the teacher they will automatically know if a student is struggling and in what topic. Thius could be very valuable to create a strong teacher studnent realtionship where the teacher is able to understant the smallest change in emotion to when they're confused or if they understamd it. This relationship could improving the learning environment and how comfortable a student with their students and peers. This technology could help teachers in both big and small schools. In big lecture halls, it may seem to be difficult for a professor to understand the emotions of all the students sitting before them, they might not even be able to see everyone because some may sit further away. With this new technology, teachers could be notified when some students become confused and then revisit a topic. Small classrooms could benifit greatly to this as well. Althought they are in a closer proximity then in lecture halls, they still will have the issue of not understanding the emotions which could lead to confusion. In smaller classrooms the teacher could know what they're doing wrong and be able to fix this easily without having to disturb the students. They can evaluate the emotions throughout the lesson and then later, they can change their lesson plans to adapt to the confusion of the students. This is again, a very valuable piece of technology that could help the teachers grow in their profession.

Initally one may think that this technology is redundant and that a teacher could just help the student, and that it may be invading the students privacy. In reality, this technology continues to prove its many values, and it's evergrowing amount of benifits that completly overpower all the ideas that some may think its unnimportant. This technology is valuable to both teachers and students equally. The teachers are able to improve their teaching techniques and the students understand more in school. This technology, however, is nowhere near done. This technology can be further improved in many aspects. I could keep improving and always creating a smarter version of the present day technology, that may one day, change the course of education forever. This could be implemented in the online schools to understand if a student comprehends the information the value of this is unspeakable and should be institued in classrooms globally.",751

Nevertheless, the technology could be used to show how and when students in school become confused or bored with a subject, just like the author stated. It could also advance our understanding of how emotions work. The Mona Lisa, who we saw in the picture, looks like she has a weird cross between a smile and a frown. It is very fascinating how this all works. This can also tell us if celebrities and politicians are being truthful.

Some people still believed that there was a Face and the reason that it looked like a natural landform and not a face was because it was winter where the Face was located and it was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face and they thought that the alien markings were hidden in the haze.

Everyday choices, like deciding what shirt to wear or what to eat for lunch, generally do not have a huge impact or require much consideration. However, a time will come when you have to make a difficult decision that could affect many things in your life. In these situations, people tend to turn to their friends and family for advice. Before making the final decision, it is best to collect the opinions of multiple people. Seeking advice from more than one person will benefit you as everyone has different experiences and opinions, and you will learn the pros and cons of different views.

The first reason you should talk to different people before making an important decision is everybody has a different experiences an opinions. For example, if you are deciding where you want to go to collage and you ask your uncle, a James Madison University graduate, where he thinks you should go, he will most likely try to convince you that JMU is the best option. However, if you ask your aunt, a University of Virginia graduate, she will probably give reasons why you should attended UVA and not JMU.

It is important to talk to multiple people so you can better understand different perspectives and experiences.

The second reason getting advice from multiple people is helpful is you can understand both the pros and cons of your options. People are biased because of their experiences, and this can lead them to tell you the wonderful things about their opinions and the horrible things about otherÃÂ´s ideas. If you only ask one person for advice, you will only get half an opinion. This will leave you as misinformed as an inexperienced child. Collecting advice from many people allows you to hear positive and negative points about your choices.

All in all, seeking advice from multiple people can help you when making a challenging decision because you will receive opinions that allow you to view different experiences and you can see the pros and cons of your options. It will give you more knowledge about your decision and help you feel more comfortable with your final decision. If you are facing a challenging choice and turn to your loved ones for advice, be sure to ask a few of them!",389

One main reason limiting motor vehicle transportation would be the best thing to do for the environment is because of the fact that, for example the exhaust of the vehicles in a densly populated area would cause a lot of physical damage to parks or gardens. The gasses that come out of the exhaust prevent full healthy growth of plants, which in terms means less trees and we need trees to help turn carbon dioxide into oxygen so we can breathe. It also helps us to breathe better if we could all just carpool with friends because it would cause less vehicles to be out on the road and in turn create an environment where all those chemicals aren't coming out of as many cars.

Besides just the fact that it would create cleaner air for us to breathe, the fact also remains that it would also be safer to drive everywhere without getting into a car crash. Car crashes are one of the leading causes of death for people all over the world, but if people stop driving their own cars everywhere there wouldn't be as many cars on highways, intersections or any other roads, there would be much less congestion making it easier to see what is around the vehicle you are traveling and it'll help save lives.

But limiting motor transportation doesn't only help out with the environment, it also helps out with your budget! If you were to sell your vehicle and ride a bike to work everyday or just catch a ride with a friend or relative, you won't have to worry about your payments on the car. You wouldn't have to pay for your car insurrence, your actual monthly payments,for any repairs on your car incase of an accident, and since you won't have a car you won't end up with any tickets for speeding or parking in the incorrect spot(s). The only thing you'd have to worry about is giving a $20 to whoever takes you to work that week.

I think that venus should be explored because then there could possibly be new life there and we can have a new planet that possibly people could go to but it wouldnt be possible for many more years. It would be dangerous exploring venus because it is really hot there. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientist to float above the fray usuing a blimp like vehicle that is about 30 miles above venus. The tempature would still be like 170 degrees but air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth. Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed earths levels. Not easy conditions but it would be survivable for humans.",229

The Electoral College is currently being used for our elections. The articles ""Does the Electoral College Work?"" and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard Posner believes the Electoral College should continue to stay in use. On the other hand, the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer believes that the Electoral College should be removed from the system of electing the President. While the Electoral College has been in use for a majority of the time, it is time to start a different process called popular vote.

The Electoral College has been in place for many years and has produced good results. One good thing the Electoral College does is it prevents a candidate from becoming President if they only have regional appeal. This is crucial because ""a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president"" Posner. With the Electoral College in place it makes it impossible to for a candidate with only regional appeal to become president because no region has enough electoral votes to elect them. Another helpful thing the Electoral College does is it has a certainty of outcome, so it is less likely for disputes than popular votes. It is less likely for disputes because ""the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"" Posner. Even if a state has a few more votes for the Electoral College it still creates a huge victory. Even though the Electoral College has produces some good results, presidents being elected through popular vote will be better, more efficient, and more equal.

Again, the popular vote will be more fair. It will be more fair because a president with more popular votes will win. In the Electoral College, a candidate with the most popular votes does not ensure victory because the other candidate may have more electoral votes. This happened in 2000 when Al Gore got more popular votes, but lost the presidency Plumer. The Electoral College is not fair to the citizens of this country and to the candidates. If more people prefer one candidate over the other, then the president should clearly clearly be them. The Electoral College is also not fair because if there is a tie, then the vote goes to the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives' ""selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people"" Plumer. The majority of the House of Representatives is Republicans, so the president elected will be reflected by that, and it will not give the Democrats equal representation. All in all, popular vote should be used to determine the President because it is a more fair and an equal way to do so.

Equally important, popular vote should be used to elect the President because then candidates and voters will pay attention to the campaign. With the Electoral College candidates only spend time trying to win the votes of the ""swing states."" They will not pay attention to the states that they already know have their vote. In fact, in the 2000 campaign, there were seventeen states that the candidates never visited. Two of those are Rhode Island and South Carolina Plumer. Every state should be able to see the candidates so the voters get to really know who they are voting for, so they will make a better decision. Also, with the Electoral College people in states that know their vote will not matter will not pay attention to the campaign. A person such as, a ""Republican in California... have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote"" Posner. Everyones opinion should matter and should be taken into account when electing the President. To summarize, popular vote is the only way to ensure that the voters get all the knowledge they need to elect the President, and so that everyone's vote matters.

In conclusion, electing the President is a painstaking task and should be done using popular vote, not the Electoral College. The President of the United States plays an important role in our country. The President has to make many difficult decisions, and those decisions should be a reflection of the entire country. It should not just reflect the certain states that contributed their electoral vote.",763

3219,0,1,0.655577540397644,0.34442248940467834,"The effect of cars in our world today has grown tremendously. As companies create new models of various cars, buyers don't often think twice about how these cars hurt the environment and cause serious global emissions. The production of ""Hybrids"" is the first step to solving this problem. The advantages of limiting car usage can result in a decrease in pollution, a more relaxed personal budget, and a safer community.

Pollution amounts have skyrocketed in the past several years. Due to the increase in the amount of people on the road using motor vehicles, pollution has increased and is becoming more of a threat than ever before. In Vauban, Germany, a new community has been constructed, and contains suburban pioneers that have given up their cars. They are devoted to taking public transit, such as city buses, or even personal vehicles like a bicycle. ""As a result, 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" CarFree Cities, Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars. The residents of this community are committed to preserving Earth by limiting their car usage to reduce pollution. Pollution is a harmful matter that can cause negative effects to an area. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States."" CarFree Cities, Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars. When you limit the amount of time you use your car, not only does it reduce pollution, but it also saves you money, now that you are not paying a monthly fee, or taxes on the car, or for gas every month.

In the exquisite community in Vauban, Germany, many of those people have gotten rid of their car, and are now probably saving extremely high amounts of money. Between highway tolls, gas, oil changes, insurance, and the overall monthly payment on a car, these residents are saving so much money because they are not paying for all of these necessities. When they travel, they use public transit, like the city bus, which costs a fraction of what car owners pay. Paris is trying to limit the amount of individual transportation due to the smog in the area, so they made a deal. ""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday, according to the BBC."" Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog. People taking public transit are saving even more money now. Due to the intense smog in Paris, and the busy streets, a limit was set for the amount of drivers allowed on the road throughout the week. ""On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters...Twentyseven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine."" Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog. Compared to the amount of money car owners spend, people without a car save a lot more money.

With the reduction of car usage, a safer community will result as well. The amounts of accidents will be substantially lower. With fewer cars on the road, the risks of car crashes greatly decrease. Many accidents result in impatience at the wheel, and careless drivers. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog..."" Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog. Bogota, Columbia created a day for no car usage and it turned out to be a very big success, spreading across borders and leaving an impression on other countries about how limited car usage positively effects the environment. ""It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators faced 25 fines."" Source 3: Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota. Countries across the globe are attempting to limit car usage, and it will begin to greatly help the environments. ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" Source 4: The End of Car Culture.

The effect of cars today is not a positive thing, except for hybrid cars. Countries are beginning to limit car usage and soon we will see the impact and changes in the enviromments due to car reduction. Clearly, the advantages of limiting car usage result in a decrease in pollution, a more relaxed personal budget, and a safer community.",788
3250,0,1,0.9999544620513916,4.552328755380586e-05,"While the idea of using a Facial Action Coding System in the educational process would certainly be interesting, I do not think it is nearly advanced enough to be able to be used in modern schools. While the technology may be able to find the hidden emotions behind the famous portrait Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, that does not mean it is in a position to help students learn. Simply put, the Facial Action Coding System does not have the viability, efficacy, or privacy needed in order to supplement learning.

Even if we allowed camera's to scan the faces of students in school, we would not be able to decode their emotions in a speed befiting our educational system today. At the seventh passage, the author states that, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,"" suggesting that the majority of modern computers do not have the power to actually run the software. The PCs that schools buy are almost never more powerful than the ones bought by consumers for household use, and would thus also not be able to process the data, making the technology rather useless in an educational setting. Even if a school had the funds to buy a computer that could process the data quickly enough to be useful, there are simply too many students for that one computer to process, which would make the entire system useless.

If we were to simply put that first fact aside and instead look at the ability for this technology to assist students in an ideal setting, we still find that students can fake their emotions in order to cheat the system. In the third passage of the artice, the author states, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness ... and then associated each with charactersitic movements of the facial muscles,"" meaning that the software associated voluntary or involuntary movements of the face with emotions. The problem with this system is that students can change the look of their face quite easily, and can thus convince the computer to produce desired results, making the system disfunctional. There are quite a few reasons children, especially young ones, would want to make the software not work, including tricking the computer into moving from the original learning program into a more desired one and them simply wanting to see the program fail through their abilities.

The idea of being able to find out the emotions of all of the chidlren in a school on a whim also rises privacy concerns that would need to be addressed before any program including this software would be implemented. The information gathered from students could be used for selfish purposes, as explained in the sixth passage of the article, ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different,"" showing that companies have use for this technology to better their businesses. If ad companies managed to get this emotional information from students all across the country, either from the government itself or through illegal actions, they could use that information to make new products and ads that would try to exploit the emotions of children. Because of this and the added concern of giving the information to the government itself, many parents would oppose a system that tracks and records the emotions of children.

Because of the lack of availablity, the potential cheating of the software, and the privacy concerns involved, the Facial Action Coding System is not able to be used in its current state to benefit schools. While this technology could be used in the future to help students, for example students with mental disabilities, it is not able to do so as it is now. It will be interesting to see what this and similar technologies grow to be, for better or for worse.",653
3545,0,1,0.9999793767929077,2.0603016309905797e-05,"Dear School board,

Why does a student's education matter? To me, it is extremely important because it can affect them for their entire life in positive or in negative ways. It could lead them to a job with a seven figure salary, or to work a part-time job at a fast food restaurant making minimum wage. What's also important to me is the learning experience. I believe learning should be fun, interesting, and not stressful for students. That's why I agree with the school board's plan to extend the school day by one and a half hours, because that way, students wouldn't feel rushed and would have more time to learn, teacher will have more time to teach and using new ways, and the school year would be a little shorter.

To begin with, I agree with the school board to extend the school day because students wouldn't feel rushed and they would have more time to learn. Right now, each of our periods are only about 50 minutes, which I think really isn't a lot of time to learn once you start working. If one and a half hours is added to the current school day, we would have at least an hour for each class. This way, the students would have more time to complete projects, assignments, or just have more time to really understand the subject without feeling rushed. I know this because right now, I am working on a project in science class that we only have two class periods to finish, which totals for just about one and a half hours! I am not saying that a little push isn't necessary or beneficial, but the extra time would definitely boost the quality of the student's work at our school without rushing them.

Secondly, I think the school board should increase the school day by one and a half hours because that will let teachers have more time to teach, while using unique ways to do so. With the students having more time to learn, the teachers could potentially also have more time to actually create a better learning experience. Extending the day ensures that teachers would be able to thoroughly explain new concepts and materials, while also teaching using better or more effective methods that wouldn't have been possible because of the shortage of time. For instance, sometimes we have educational scavenger hunts, where the teacher lays the information throughout the campus and we would have to find them. The issue is, we've never been able to finish, not because it wasn't possible to, but because there simply wasn't enough time. Those kinds of educational activities are, in my opinion, very fun, but it's also effective. So if we have more time, I am sure that some teachers would plan and teach more using different ways which are beneficial to both the student and the teacher.

Lastly, the school board's plan to extend one and a half hours to the school day is something I strongly concur with because school will be out earlier in the summer. While I do enjoy school very much, I think summer break is something that everyone looks forward to. The days that are cut down because of the increased time allows students to attend more activities and spend more time together with their families. Even though the students aren't at school, they could still be learning something new on their own. For example, they could be learning how to play an instrument, training for sports, or learning how to speak another language, which are all very helpful for them. Also, the teachers could be attending conferences which let's them collaborate with other teachers on creating newer and more efficient methods to teach, which will help everyone in the long run.

In conclusion, the reasons why I agree with the school board to extend the hours are because students wouldn't feel rushed, teachers would have more time to teach in unique ways, and school will be out sooner in the summer. Although I think there are many more reasons why the school day should be longer, those are the main ones. There are just so many benefits that this extended time would create; possibly having an effect on the entire community. This is not an immense amount of change but it can be a big success, which is why I think you should really consider extending the school hours.

Sincerely,

Everybody has a different character trait and I believe it is formed by our parents, brothers, or sisters. It is the responsibility of adults to teach their child how to behave and that is usually how their traits are formed. As children begin to go to school, most often they meet other kids and become friends. Friends also have an influence on how traits are formed like for example: Kindness, friendly, honest, and more. The influence mainly comes from parents and are the role models for their children. Our character traits are formed by influences. Many people around the world have different character traits, Everyone is different on the way they behave around others. Therefore they are formed. My character traits are quiet, funny, and calm. These traits for formed because of school and my friends. John Lubock mentions that ""your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""

This technology can be very useful to techers as well as anyone else. If a student is feeling a lot of emotion and trying to do school work, they will be more focused on what they were feeling instead of the work the teacher has given him/her. It can also help the teacher to know how exactly to act twards a student. For example, if a student is feeling 75% sad they are most likely going to cry. If a student is about to cry and teacher starts yeling at them for not paying attention, because the student isn't feeling like themselves that day its going to trigger the students brain to make them cry.

In conclusion, this tehcnology in my opinion should most defiently be used in schools. Not only to help the teachers out, but for the stundents themelves. I think that if we use this technology it will increase focuse on school work will improve moods, and increase better grades and testing scores.",206
3665,0,1,0.9998987913131714,0.0001012040302157402,"Emotions and being able to recognize them when they occur have a lot to do with our human ability to learn and pick up information. if perhaps, one is feeling confused, it would be much harder for them to be able to retain information being thrown at them. we see this a lot in the educational environment. At school, students must be attentive and ready to learn before they are actually able to start the process of learning. This goes hand-in-hand with the idea that schools, as well as the education system shoud pay more attention to students' emotions towards subjects, contrasting enthusiasm to pick up a new idea with boredom followed by inability to focus. This being said, the new software being used to detect emotion from facial expressions could be a rather helpful tool in the everyday classroom for years to come.

Every student has a different set of feelings, all are complex creatures with opinions on subjects that could differentiate them from one another. Some are better at learning subjects they are more interested in while others have the ability to devote time into learning any subject that school has to throw at them. The point remaining is that none are the same and so, teaching methods for students should become more indivualized to fit each students unique learning style and ability. It is possible that the computerized Facial Action Coding System could aid in the process of making these learning styles more fit for each student rather than just having them for the masses. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts, 'then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Having a computer monitor to read emotions from facial expressions could display to teachers how each student reacts to the information that they are learning, allowing teachers to make adjustmants in their teaching styles where they see fit. This could give students the ability to learn more effectively for their feelings towards subjects as they are personalized based on reaction as they continue.

The Facial Acting Coding System is a very complex process consisting not only of computer scientists but also of a team of psychologists using expertise to read peoples' emotions through their faces, using scientific evidence along the way. This could mean that, while it is a newer system, it is a well-proven one, making the classroom a good place to continue perfecting it. ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal,' observes Dr. Huang, 'even though individuals ofren show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Monda Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in Davinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This line from the informative piece displays the process of determining emotions through computer technologies. It shows that it is well-tested and understood by its administrators as well as those in support of it, gaining it credibility as a method tested and used. this means that, while it is a newer technology, it could be used in the classrooms to continue to perfect the software by gaining more facial expressions from students, making it even more effective for its participants.

While the software detecting facial expressions is a good idea for countless reasons, it also has a few downfalls. One disadvantage of this technology could be its lack of other uses besides reading emotions of students as far as classrooms go. Some may argue that installation of this likely pricey software would not be worth the pay or the hassle of overall installation. To this, one could argue that allowing students to have a more personalized appraoch to learning should be enough to convince those against it that it is worthwhile. Students being able to learn in an environment as well as manner specifically tailored to their indivual learning abilities and styles will benefit us as a society not only in the future, as today's current students become tomorrow's important business officials and doctors, but also currently, as these students will have less stress devoted to worrying about trying to learn something they are disinterested in or simply don't understand. Altogether, the good outweigh the bad in this current argument.

Computerized sytems used to understand and display human emotions do belong in today's classroom. The benefits of this approach are numerous for both teachers and students being effected as well as for the future when these students are more outspoken, functioning members of society. This can be displayed that, not only would these systems help students to become more able and excited to learn in their own way, but it would also allow teachers to more effectively complete their jobs by editing approaches to learning to fit each student's individual syle and ability. It is also a well-understood and well backed-up process with scientific study allowing direct research to show its credibiltiy. Having students using this technologuy could also allow for the technology to become more credible as more emotions of individuals are entered into the technology. Finally, the price of these systems would not matter in the long-run as this would be money invested into the future of society as these students grow with a solid, quality education. Altogether, the good outweigh all the downfalls in this experiment and it should be introduced into classrooms in the following years to improve the quality of education.",932

Society is moving toward an almost completely digital lifestyles, causing the youth to become even more involved in phones, computers, and etc. Although this ongoing innovation is an improvement, it also has made its case as a potential hazard to today's generation. Specifically, when combining the machinery of vehicles, which are capable of killing passengers at personality of cellphones, the result is fatal disaster. Basically, while cellphones are helpful technology, drivers should rarely or never use them when operating any vehicle.

Primarily, as the number of people using cell phones while driving will also increase on streets and highways. At the same time rate, drivers still talk on cell phones and send text messages while driving. They will also engaging in other activities apart from driving. For example, drives will text when driving, and they will dial numbers. Drivers will also receive calls and talk on their devices for long periods of time. Again, driving demands your full attention, and your concentration which is taken away when talking on the phone. However, it means that the driver has to divert his attention to the conversation, which leads to less concentration on the road. All in all, one can connect accidents and cell phone usage while driving to this very diversion of attention.

Furthermore, drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person's life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Ad a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. This puts both drivers and even pedestrians in harm's way.

However, in order to remain a fair republic that truly takes into account the opinions of all citizens, we must make one major change. The flawed Electoral College must be abolished and replaced with election by popular vote in order to ensure the well being of our country.

Proponents of the Electoral College would gasp in horror at this suggestion, arguing that their systematic method is virtually foolproof. Nevertheless, with a voting method as complicated as the Electoral College, the room for error is far too great. Just look at what happened in 1960, when racist legislators tried to replace the democratic electors chosen by popular vote in order to sabotage John F. Kennedy's chances. Then yet another electoral disaster occurred in 2000. Both of these events could very easily happen again and the consequences of such mistakes are unfathomable. History has been proven to repeat itself, and this is no exception. Who's to say that electors won't just ignore the wishes of voters or that legislators won't manipulate the system? When it comes to choosing our leader, whose actions will ultimately decide whether or not America will continue to survive and thrive, it would be a huge mistake to leave this responsibility to one group of individuals. After all, nobody is perfect.

Furthermore, advocates of the Electoral College make a major fallacy when they claim that voters in swing states are more informed on election information, therefore it's good that the electoral system causes candidates to only focus on them. Just consider the fact that by completely ignoring all of the other states, campaigners are ignoring millions of individuals who deserve to have a say in who will be in charge. Through this one argument, advocates are essentially assuming anyone who doesn't live in a swing state doesn't care about the election as much and therefore they shouldn't have a say in the matter. This is simply not true. In fact, these advocates fail to acknowledge that if voters in other states are not as educated or interested, it is a consequence of the Electoral College. While politicians are focusing all of their time and effort on the thoughtful voters, other citizens don't get the information they need from seeing campaigns and meeting candidates. They are deprived of the opportunity to make an educated decision like swing voters and that is a fault of the college, not the voters themselves.

The problems with the Electoral College only go on. If a tie were to occur, the election would be determined by members of the House of Representatives, who do an even poorer job of representing the people considering each state casts only one vote. Also, due to the fact that the Electoral College mainly operates with the winnertakeall rule, it is easy for individuals in Democratic or Republican states to feel as if their vote doesn't matter.

It is also important to note that at the end of the day, election by popular vote accomplishes the goal of reflecting the opinion of the public far better than election by Electoral College. The popular vote is a clear statement of voters' opinions and is virtually unable to be tampered with. On the other hand, the Electoral College only complicates the situation by introducing a middle man who is prone to bribery and mistakes. Why should we allow candidates to win because of the electoral vote if they do not recieve the overall approval of the public? Compare the opinions of 538 electors to the opinions of hundreds of millions of voters. Evidently, the opinions of all these voters cannot be properly represented by these 538 electors. It's just impossible both logistically and logically.

For all of these reasons, I urge you to change the system to election by popular vote. It is without a doubt the only way this country can continue to be the great nation that it is for centuries to come.",688

As we all know today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

I will explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Primarily, I believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle but then there are always extenuating circumstances and we will cover both why I believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle and the extenuating circumstances that may arise.

For instance, let us look at my home State of Georgia.

According to the Department of Driver Services, ""Drives are allowed to use hands free devices (specific ones) and voice to text with hands free devices and allowed to use permanent mounted GPS, Drivers are allowed to make emergency calls and report hazardous road conditions"" (Source:

dds. georgia. gov).

Further according to DDS Commissioner, Spencer R. Moore, ""Georgia law currently prohibits all drivers, regardless of age, from using a wireless telecommunications devise to engage in writing, sending, or reading any text-based communication.

Teen drivers under the age of 18 who possess either a learner's permit or a provisional license are prohibited from using a wireless telecommunications device for any reason, including voice communication, except in cases of emergency or if the care was lawfully parked"" (p. 1)

These laws were enacted because distracted drivers claim lives and injuries.

I am an 18-year old driver and I have the mindset of an 18-year old so speaking for myself, I do not use a cell phone in any capacity while driving not even my navigation system.

Similarly to adjusting my mirrors and my car seat, I set up my navigation device prior to starting the ignition.

To me, personally, it is far more important to me to arrive alive and to not harm others than to have the conveniences of a cell phone while driving.

Conclusion

In conclusion, primarily, I believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle but then there are always extenuating circumstances and I have covered both why I believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle and the extenuating circumstances that may arise.

The popularity of mobile devices has had some unintended and sometimes deadly consequences. An alarming number of traffic accidents are linked to driving while distracted, including use of mobile devices while driving, resulting in injury and loss of life. The most recent national statistics are sobering. 3,166 people were killed by distracted driving in 2017 alone, 8.5 percent of total fatalities for the year.

Approximately nine people are killed and more than 1,000 injured daily in the United States in incidents reported as involving a distracted driver. During daylight hours across America, approximately 481,000 drivers are using cell phones while driving. Teens were the largest age group reported as distracted at the time of fatal crashes. Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving.

While texting while driving certainly doesn't always lead to a fatality, there are a wealth of statistics that show that texting and driving is directly connected to traffic deaths. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use leads to 1.6 million crashes on a yearly basis while texting while driving is six times more likely to cause a crash than drunk driving is. One out of every four traffic crashes that occur in the U.S. are spurred by cell phone usage, and furthermore, each day, 11 teens die as a result of texting and driving, which is a downright astounding number. Over 3,000 teens and young drivers die yearly due to texting while driving.

Almost every state has laws strictly prohibiting texting while driving, and those who don't often consider it a distracted driving offense. States that once allowed texting while driving have since cracked down on distracted driving. Many states also prohibit talking on the phone while driving unless you are using a hands-free device. If you are a commercial driver, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) prohibits all commercial drivers from using hand-held mobile devices.

Distracted driving consists of driving while distracted in any manner. While cell phone use is often a part of it, distracted driving also encompasses many other activities, including eating, reading, drinking, talking to other passengers, looking around, adjusting location devices, adjusting the radio or any other activity that takes the driver's attention away from the task of driving. While any of these activities may be involved, texting while driving is usually considered the most serious type of distracted driving because it causes the most types of distraction.",441

4166,0,1,0.9999719858169556,2.8031574402120896e-05,"Why is is beneficial to have limited car usage? This is a question that has several answers varying from personal health, to economic gain, to environmental gain. Though the car has been the symbol of the modern age, there seem to be few downsides to limiting the usage of these transportation units.

Cars have given mankind the ability to cross great distances in a short amount of time, allowing face to face communication, fast trade between companies and nations, and access to medical and personal care otherwise out of reach. However, the car has also caused lack of mobility, cutting back on people's exercise as they no longer have to walk very far to get from point A to point B, the overwhelming responsibility and cost of owning a car has also put a mental strain on people, causing needless stress. Of course there are places to go and things to do that require traveling large distances, and no one could be a expected to walk from New York to L.A., so car usage should not be utterly removed, but rather restricted.

So how do people properly regulate their car usage? Several different governments and cities have debated this, trying different tactics and having varied results. As shown in Elisabeth Rosenthal's essay, ""In German Suburbs, Life Goes On Without Cars"" , we are shown the result of a community where 70% of the people do not own cars, but with no less activity than their counterparts in cities weighed down by cars. There seem to be several advantages in this city without cars, one being that people seem to be happier. Heidun Walter, a media trainer with two children informed Rosenthal, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"", the lack of cars seems to reduce stress, without restricting life.

So perhaps this is not enough reason for some to limit their usage of the car, alright, there are many more reasons why this is beneficial. One that is quite familiar to all is the issue of greenhouse gas emissions. The majority of cars produce greenhouse gas emissions, polluting the environment and quickening the death of the planet, Rosenthal's essay "" In German Suburbs, Life Goes On Without Cars, "", we are told clearly that, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gass emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. "" This may seem like very little, but with the amount of cars in the world, these numbers add up to staggering damage to the environment. Robert Duffer wrote an essay telling of these harmful effects in a shocking way: "" "". This city had so much pollution that they had to ban the use of cars, ""Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London,"". This pollution is not only in France, but across the globe, it is only a matter of time before it destroys the ecosystems on Earth, and cars are one of the biggest contributers to this destruction, coming in second only to power plants.

One Colombian city chose not to wait until such things happened, instead choosing to promote limited car usage in a more peacful manner, as described by Andrew Selsky's essay, "" Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota "". This city of 7 million people started a program that chooses one day a year to bann all car usage with the exception of buses and taxis, fining violators with 25. One main benefit has come out of this: People are more active phisically and therefore have less stress. Selsky's essay can be quoted saying, "" millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday,"". The benefits of more physical movement are obvious, but one is not so obvious: It lowers stress. A businessman by the name of Carlos Arturo Plaza said, ""It is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". If a simple day can cause such drastic changes in the environment, peoples health, and lower stress, why not go ahead and do it?

In summary, while cars help us get from point A to point B quickly, and are very useful when traveling over great distance, they also cause great harm. A simple cut back on using cars would allow the air pollution to be reduced drastically, promote physical movement and personal health, and help productivity and creativity by reducing stress.",762

One such technology allows a computer to recognize a person's emotions based on the movement of muscles in their face. Some say this technology can be used in the classroom to slow down a lesson for a confused student, or make it more interesting for a bored one. However, the truth is that while this technology certainly has its merits, it may not be reliable in the classroom because it cannot accurately determine a person's emotions, understand their cause, or properly respond to them.

Although fairly accurate at times, this software that detects emotions may not be always accurate. For example, according to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the software calculates that the woman in the famous painting ""Mona Lisa"" is ""2 percent angry."" This is likely untrue, and Leonardo da Vinci probably never intended this. She does not appear angry, and if anything, da Vinci simply could not recognize facial expressions well enough to accurately depict the emotions that he intended the subject of the painting to have. Additionally, the article states that there are six basic emotions the software can detect: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. These emotions are useful, but this also means the computer cannot detect emotions like guilt and confusion. These are very important emotions in the classroom, and the computer must be able to detect if a student cheats on a test or does not understand a concept. The software is very limited in detecting emotions, and this could lead to adverse consequenses.

Sometimes, not only are a person's emotions unclear, but the cause of a person's emotions may not be obvious given the current context, because people often live in the past. A student may appear to be confused, but only because the student does not understand a joke they heard before the lesson. The article says that the computer could recognize this confusion and modify the lesson, despite the fact that the student's confusion has nothing to do with the lesson in the first place. Also, if a student does not understand a certain part of the lesson material, the computer will not be able to detect the exact part; the student will be confused no matter what part it is. The computer will be forced to explain and clarify everything, when the student may only need a small part clarified. In a similar way, the student may still not understand the material afterwards, but the computer cannot ask the student why this is so, because it only detects the student's confusion.

While detecting emotions and their causes are important in the classroom, the most important thing is responding to them appropriately. For example, if a student is feeling sad, this will likely affect their retention of the material being taught. However, the computer likely cannot alleviate or eradicate this sadness, because it is most likely caused by an outside source. The computer may try to comfort the student, but the student will know that the computer does not actually feel any emotions and will not be comforted whatsoever. Additionally, the student may feel bored, but the computer may not be able to change this if the student feels that the material being taught is boring, because the computer has no choice but to teach this material to the student. As a result, even if the computer can detect a student's emotions, it may not be able to do much about them.

No matter how useful this emotion-reading software is, it should not be used in the classroom. It may falsely detect an emotion and change the lesson when unnecessary. It could also assume the wrong cause for an emotion, leading it to make a lesson longer or more thorough when the student understands it already. Additionally, the computer may detect emotions well, but it may not be able to fix them or change them, making the software pointless. Technology may have great benefits, but detecting emotions in the classroom is not one of them.",680
4330,0,1,0.999929666519165,7.028804975561798e-05,"One reason people seek different opinions is because some people have different opinions on what people should do. Seeking different people's opinions allows you to get all the information from all sides. If people seek more than one person's advice then you would be able to compare the information to see what you think is the best choice. Also, if people seek more than one person's advice then the person might be able to collect all the information and put it together.

Another reason people ask different people is because the first person may not be giving you the best advice. Like, what if the first person's advice is pretty good, but then the next person you ask has better advice. If the person asked advice from more than one person then you wouldn't have to be stuck with the bad information. If you just ask for one person's advice and it was bad advice then it could get you in really big trouble. Like, if you rely on one person's advice and they told you that if they start making you mad then you can put your hands on them. What if the person you put hands on presses charges then you could go to jail for a long time. If you asked another person's opinion then you may not be in the situation that you are in.

The next reason why people ask different people for adivce is because if the advice the person gave you worked for them, but it didn't work for you. Like, if a person is having trouble with their dog alerting them that they need to use the restroom. So that their dog doesn't keep going to the restroom in the house. They might say ""you could give your dog a treat when they alert you they need to go to the restroom"". If that doesn't work, but you only asked one person for advice. Then, you would be mad because the advice didn't work. Next, you would have to ask another person for advice, but at the beginning if you would have just asked more than one person then you would be able to peice the information together.

Nowadays, manufacturers and creators of products are using technologies and algorithims to analyze everything from shopping preferances, to the economic strengths and weaknesses that characterize a specific a consumer. Not to mention, with facial recognition, and widespread survelliance, complex human interactions are beginnning to be broken down into code. While some may argue against this simply because the idea of being ""watched"" does not appeal to them, these advancements have real-world applications that could actually be quite beneficial to society as a whole. The concept of the FACS program being implemented in classrooms is a concept that really should be taken into heavy consideration. The practical applications of something such as an emotional analysis program within schools, have no end. For this reason, it is concievable that the FACS program should be introduced into the fabric of the modern schooling system.

Imagine if a computer was able to comprehensively custom-tailor lessons for struggling students, based solely on their unconscious reactions to other lessons. Often times this is exactly what a student needs, and what many student activist groups have been proposing for years. The notion that a student could have a lesson that was customized to fit his or her personality, might be exactly what some parents of stuggling (and academically adept) students have been craving. In the article, Making Mona Lisa Smile, by Nick D'Alto, it is stated that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This is a compelling argument for a fairly simple reason; most students that do not do well in school, claim that it is because they do not enjoy it, or that they do not appreciate the way that information is conveyed to them. However, this can be remedied. The implementation of the FACS program within schools would provide an alternitave to traditional teaching, and could improve the overall experience of students. Besides that, the FACS program could also be used to analyze the general student reaction to a specific topic or concept. This would provide teachers with more insight into the lives and emotions of their students, and allow them to better prepare lectures, and their coverage of that topic. The article also states that, "" Most human communictation is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" Not only would the gathered information be beneficial to other parties for the betterment of schooling, but it would also allow school systems to pick up on particular emotional cues that may only be visible to someone who is emotionally close to a particular student.

This program, without a doubt, offers many helpful options when it comes to its use within school systems. The FACS system should be implemented into the fabric of modern schooling. With so many applications, It would be foolish not to at least experiment with it in a school setting. While it is true that privacy and reliability are great concerns for many people, convenience and better academics are also great concerns in today's modern society. In a culture that is beginning to value knowledge over all else, it is important for schools to employ every method available to them, to better prepare students for the life ahead of them. Technology should not be viewed as an enemy in an academic world. Rather, it should be percieved as a tool. A tool that gives humanity the ability to accomplish whatever can be dreamed, and gives it the resources necessary to lead its people into a golden era of knowledge and education.",611

There are so many times when I see other students around me struggling with different kinds of activities and lessons. Not every student is the same, so you can't expect all students to score perfect on the same assignments. In paragraph six, Dr. Haung states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This point could also help teachers connect and understand with each individual student better.

I wish we had this kind of technology at my school. I feel like if we did, I'd be able to understand many more of the concepts my teahcers are teaching. Using the Facial Action Coding System could be extremely beneficial to schools around the world.",200

The Importance of Seeking Multiple Opinions Before a Decision

Nowadays online shopping has become more and more common, resulting in the majority of people to refer to the web when purchasing items. However, the items shown on websites may not always be parallel to what it is like in real life. Making a first-hand decision can often lead to something that is unwanted, not satisfactory, or a waste of money. To prevent this, people should seek multiple opinions to help them make a better choice now and possibly in the future. This is why asking advice from more that one person is beneficial and how it helps someone gain the confidence to know that the decisions they make are correct.

Most of the times the choices someone will make causes an effect on another thing. When a bad decision is made, this can lead to circumstances that someone would rather stay away from. For example, a person has spent money on something they wanted, but later realize it was bad quality and it was not what they expected it to be. This does not only put them in a place where they have something that is disliked, but now they have also wasted their time and money when that item was bought. Instead, that person should look up that item to see what other people had to say about it or ask peers who have purchased that item their thoughts on it. This will not only bring them to a choice that they will not regret, but it will also save them from wasting time and money.

The choices someone will make are usually decided on their point of view, meaning that their decision are based solely of what they think. When someone goes to multiple viewpoints, they can see the different perspectives on how people view things. This will lead them to be more open-minded on what they choose to do. Having a more open-mind can then lead to better choices and wisdom for the future. For example, if someone knows that a specific company provides low quality items, they can know that in the future they should not buy items from that company. This means that what a person learns from making a good decision from others opinions now, can also help them make other better decisions in the future.

Many say that you should ""follow your gut,"" but this can lead to many difficult positions. Instead, someone should always seeking multiple opinions to help with choosing what to do because it can insure that they make the best choice. When a person makes a right decision, this does not only give them a decision that they will not regret, but it will also save them from wasting time and money. Choosing the right thing to do now can also help them in the future when making decisions related to their past scenario. The decision someone makes might seem small on the outside, but truly when a good choice is made, this can change a persons life for the best. That is why making a right choice is important, and a person can only make the best decision when they have talked with more than one person.",548
4664,0,1,0.9999469518661499,5.2992232667747885e-05,"In our modern age, cars have become one of the most widespread means of transportation in our world. They can provide reliable transportation from one place to another, but we could benefit greatly from limiting our drastic use of motorized vehicles.

While cars maintain their status as one of the largest transportation mediums, they are also beginning to rival powerplants in their emissions of greenhouse gases. For example, in America and many EU countries, Motorized vehicles are second in to powerplants in greenhouse gas emissions.

Now, since greenhouse gases are contributing to global warming, and cars are a major contributor to those emissions, it would be beneficial to cut down on our usage of them. In Paris, smog levels had reached such a dramatic level that the government placed a partial ban on motorized vehicles to cut down car emissions.

Today in society people all have a cell phone to call, text or explore things that may interest them. They also have access to a vehicle (Car, Truck, RV, Etc.) to which they can drive from place to place. Phones and vehicles are the same since both are a privilege to have and are not a basic human right. The use of allowing one to drive a vehicle while he or she uses a phone is an interesting topic to discuss. Both are also what teenagers are expected to get when they reach the age of 16.

In my opinion I believe that phones should not be used while a driver is driving. Driving is important to reduce time to get from one place to another. It can be dangerous to drive if one does not focus on the road. If someone is driving and they waste a second on their phone they could harm or possibly kill someone for not looking who is in front of them. Driving with a phone or in your lap could even distract you long enough to not get the steering wheel and may worsen one's driving skills.

Also if one decides to drive with their phone they are not just putting everyone else at risk, they're putting themselves at risk as well. According to a statistic 58% of teen crashers are because of distracted driving. Meaning that without the use of their phone more than half of teen crashes would be reduced and less harm would be done. Another study states ""Text messaging increases the risk of crash or near-crash by 23 times."" Meaning that just receiving or glancing at the phone for a second could cause a crash.

However, phones can or should be used only in an emergency. An example is when one needs directions to get to a location that is fine to use the phone. If there is Bluetooth, then connect it to the cell phone if it is compatible to focus more on the road. Or if you need to use your phone just find somewhere to park or stop somewhere and use your phone there. Unless it is for an emergency or something of great importance this is the only time a phone should be allowed.

In conclusion, phones should not be allowed to be used while in a car. Text messages and phone calls themselves cause unnecessary to both civilians and to oneself.

My name is PROPER_NAME.

A very popular topic that has been floating around in recent political conversations is the process, or in more familiar terms: fairness, in the steps used in the Electoral College to select a President for the United States of America. Or, perhaps ironically so, lack therfore of directly selecting a President. It is this particular topic that has inquired me to send you this letter regarding the upcoming debate: Should the Electoral College Stay Or Go?

Now don't get me wrong here: I legitimately don't believe anything I say could really have a major impact on any type of consideration towards this debate, I just hope you read this and ponder it's words to fully make a positive choice-whichever path you choose to side with in this. Our Forefathers created the Electoral College because they believed it to be the best method in securing a true democratic result for the leader of the USA. People say that the Electoral College is outdated because the times have moved on... well then, if that's true, I suppose we should just drop America's image of Freedom because it was made by some stupid old guys. Ummm... No. It is LOGICAL that true DEMOCRACY would be the greater portion of the PEOPLE that VOTE for the PRESIDENT. The opposite side of this argument says that it is unfair some of the states are skipped over because defeat is guarenteed. Defeat is guarenteed... don't people understand what that means? Here, let me explain it to you guys reeeeeeeeeeeeall simple so you can understand it: 1+1=2. ther ya go. job well done.",275

For example, a boy is challenged with the option of running for the highest leadership in his community. What shall he do to make sure that he is making the right choice? To put it simply, your average boy next door has the opportunity to be a youth leader in his community. With natural leadership skills, his parents have no doubt that we would make a good leader, but doubt still seems to be a deciding factor. Our boy is faced with doubt and overwhelming uncertainty of his options. With so much going on, he has no idea of what he should, and can do. Would you, as his neighbor help him? When people have a decision to make, consulting more than one person can oftentimes lead to the better choice. Sometimes, others can have more knowledge than you, and therefore would be a better source. Others, especially adults with more experience can even tell you possible outcomes of your decision. Seeking advice from people with experience, knowledge, and wisdom can help you make the right decision.

More than one set of eyes on a topic can be a good thing sometimes. With more people reviewing your choices they could catch mistakes, or even tell you what you could do to improve your idea or choice. For example, when I wanted to buy a new camera, I was torn between so many different options. After asking my parents, friends, and family, I finally made the best choice for my money. Even when you have a small decision to make, like what to buy for lunch, asking your friends could help you get the best option they have to offer. Even when the President is making decisions, he too has people he can ask for advice. No matter what choice or decision you have to make, asking others for advice is a healthy option.

When others have more knowledge than you, their opinions and advice can be more in depth, practiced, or even more intelligent. To put it into perspective, if you have a question on math homework, asking the teacher would be more beneficial that asking your peer, or table mate. If you want to switch classes, or change your schedule, asking a counselor, or teacher with more knowledge than you can help you make the right decision too. Even when a high school student is applying to college, they too would ask their parents for advice. Using other's experienced advice, older knowledge and wisdom can lead you down the road to the right choice.

When making a big decision, sometimes asking somebody who has done such a thing before can tell you the outcome, or give you experienced advice. If a girl wants to get contacts, she could ask her parents, family members, or teachers who have had contacts before for advice. They themselves have had it before, so they would know the outcome, and therefore would be a great resource for advice. I know that when I wanted to go to summer camp, I asked my teacher who had been there before. She knew what it was like, and could tell me all about it so I knew I was making the right decision. Even when an aspiring actor or singer wants to join the industry, they too ask those who have gone through the same process for advice, or what to expect as an outcome. Asking those with experience, or previous knowledge can not only help you make the right choice, but also tell you about an outcome that the choice might provide.

Seeking advice from people with experience, knowledge, and wisdom can most definitely help you make the right decision. So, would you help the boy next door? If you have been through what he is experiencing, would you offer him advice? It can be tough to find people, but more than one person reviewing a topic or choice can help someone make the right decision. Having other people review your decision, or asking multiple sources can sometimes help you make the right choice. Even asking more experienced individuals can help too. When asking someone who has more in-depth knowledge, or is wiser, you can receive advice that you wouldn't have thought of. Even when making a big decision, like our boy next door, you can ask people who have done such things before. When asking those who have experienced first hand the choices you want to make, you can get opinions or advice from more experienced individuals. When you ask others for help, advice, or opinions, you have the chance to dive into a world of possibilities. When asking more than one person, you can experience even more possibilities. Asking other can give you the best help you may ever receive.",812

If you could tell how your students were feeling, it would make teaching easier. For example, if you were teaching and the computer told you all of your students were bored, then you could try to teach it in another way. Or if the computer told you all your students were exicted then you would know your doing a great job and you could teach that way more often. You would know what ways to teach to get the information into the students.

So what i think is that this computer could be really effective in a classrom. it would allow teachers to know if there students are even learning, how they feel about the way they teach, and lots more too. So if they could really use it in a classroom, im all for it.",179

But we all know of the pressures to please others as we grow up. First the pressure comes from your parents, then your young peers, on to teachers and bosses. You find yourself constantly trying to live up to the expectations of others and why not? It is usually a good things to follow the wishes of those who have raised you, and it is natural to conform to the ways of people who help you along the way. it is alot like osmosis. It is also expected that prescribed pathways are followed, in a way, to repay kindness and debts. As an example, parents pay for your education, including arts and sports activities so surely it makes sense that you would try to excel in those endeavours as a form of Thank you. The same goes for showing a good teacher or mentor that you understand their lesson and often end up developing further on the path they revealed and recommended.

However, at some point your own predictions and dreams emerge. Let them and pay attention to them as they will become your guide to your ultimate destiny. While showing respect for your parents and elders, start to forge your own identity. Those who truly love you will be on the sidelines cheering your every step. Consider he words of Dr. Seuss, ""Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't care''. I couldn't have said it any better.

Essentially, and ultimately, you don't have any choice in the decision about being yourself. Since the time of Socrates, and no doubt before, a predominant human instinct has been to know thyself. The problem for some people however is that they harbour the inner self and keep it separate from the self they display to the world. This predicament can eventually morph into a personality disorder if the gap between your inner person and public persona is too wide. Soon being in public will become a chore you will feel like a phony. you will probably end up living the life of the recluse. Not a good result for most people except the odd monk.

The best way to allow your inner self, that part of you that holds your real aspirations and dreams, to become what the world sees is to start cultivating the key aspects of those chracter traits. Start becoming that person in your mind and begin to feel this is yourtrue self soon actions will follow. You will begin to feel comfortable in your own skin. For example, if you want to become a musician then slowly tell people that you ""are planning a career in music"" and start acting that way. Surprisingly, this will start you help you as other people will begin to look at you in that light. Eventually they will tell others who are interested in the same path. Soon that will led to communications between you and a host of other like-minded people. Your network will expand and you will soon be part of a musically inclined community nurtured and growing professionally all the while gaining confidence in the new you.

Another way to look at ''finding'' yourself involves a more prosctive, less reflective path. Life is not about finding yourself ; Life is about creating yourself"".

This is the other side of the coin. Maybe our ""selves"" are like a blank slate waiting for someone to write the future. Maybe we should not dwell too much on ourselves. Too much soul searching can lead to a sort of paralysis an inertia brought on by excessive searching for the meaning.

I think we all instinctively know what we want to do it is just some of us are a little hesitant to breakout. But, it is the only way you will reduce anxiety and eventually find a sense of fulfillment. So just do it as the Nike ads encourage. Step into that real you and have some fun along the way. Be Yourself. Everyone else is taken. So, we need to keep this things into our selves that way we could improve our selves as the best human being in the world. No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.

So, I totally agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson that ""To be yourself in a world is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.",765
5137,0,1,0.9999523162841797,4.764501500176266e-05,"I believe that students attending school from home will benefit for many different reasons. Students who experience anxiety attacks, depression, bullying, or just not being able to attend school for the day will find great use in online school, they can connect with their classes or teachers without being in school and not have to miss out on important information or work. Students are able to be in a safe environment at home if they do not feel comfortable in school.

Furthermore, students with anxiety or depression may have a harder time going through out the school day then their peers. For example, my girlfriend who has very often panic attacks, dislikes attending her current school. She was a new transfer student to the school and was also new to the school itself. She found it hard to not have anybody to go to and vent during the school day which causes her to stress and have anxiety. Moreover, she gets very often panic attacks during the day which makes her not want to come to school more often. She finds it easier and safer to stay at home. When ever we're on the phone over face time, she's always doing her class work that she takes home to complete. She's a hardworking student and always does her work but because of the environment she's in, it limits her on what she is capable of.

Not only that it would help students feel secure, but for the students who are sick for the day and cannot attend school, wouldn't have to miss out on important information or work. For example; there are days where I just feel weak and tired but I wouldn't want to miss a review day for a major test the next class. If there was online school, I would be able to connect with my teacher and the classes from home where I feel comfortable. Also, my mom wouldn't have to worry that i'm failing my classes because i'm not showing up to them. I believe that other students would agree with me on this argument because almost everyone I know, wishes they could attend school from home.

Moreover, adults might not have knowledge of this, but let me tell you; there is a lot of drama and rumors in every high school. No matter where it is, the policies it has, the advances of the students, there is drama. And drama is one major factor on why students wishes to attend school at home. Just Imagine the advances of our present civilization if there was no drama at school, and no have you heard this or have you heard that. Drama and rumors are big time distractions to daily school work and it peaks the interest of every student. By enabling online school, students dedicated to become scholars are able to take this distraction out of their equation. They can attend school without dealing with the big mouths talking up and down and all around the school.

Overall, distance learning has a very good impact on the students. Students feel safer at home, and when they are sick or cannot attend school for they day, they wouldn't have to miss out on important information or work. Online school would be very beneficial for everyone.",549

Being yourself is by far the most fulfilling accomplishment any individual would have ever made. Not only does it take a lot of confidence, devotion, and self acceptance, but also the ability to learn, understand and love yourself both internally and externally.

people tend to have different role models for various reasons, for example my younger sister always wanted to be like the famous singer Beyonce because she had a beautiful voice. They might have some things in common which draws them closer to the idea of being just like them. Little do they know that them turning out exactly just like their role models is almost impossible because they lack their unique personality traits and acquire their own completely different set of traits which makes them who they are.

The sooner people realize that each individual is unique in one way or another the better. Being yourself does not mean breaking the rules because you like it but doing the right thing in your own unique way. Not only does that stand out but also makes you feel good about yourself. A perfect example would be comedian Liza Koshy from YouTube who made a whole career out of being unapologetically herself while she did comedy!.Using her as inspiration would be healthier than aspiring to be just like her.

With that I conclude that being yourself is not necessarily a walk in the park but putting effort into it would make a bigger difference than following the crowd. Ideas lead to actions and by visualizing yourself doing things correctly but in your own way is killing two birds with one stone! Author Waldo Emerson was right about being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else being the greatest accomplishment.           ",297

I can infer that the mentioned statement Prime Minister Winston had provided has an strong point of view from many perspectives. Human behavior mostly influences in their achievements and failures throughout life. To be able to achieved your expected goals without loosing enthusiasm, and demonstrating resilience is the greatest accomplishment. I strongly agree with the Churchill's statement regardless to the critical role failure plays in life. It gives the enthusiasm every individuals need in order to be successful in life, it motivates young minds to follow their expectations, and provides more knowledge in many cases since we learn from our mistakes.

Accordingly to many researches, individuals tend to give up when they are facing an obstacle in a complicated occasion, that prevented most of society to stop achieving their accomplishments due to the constant fear of experiencing failure. Society has been exacerbating this concept by creating irrational fear in those who are not willing to take risks to become better persons once they seemed to have failed, which leads to the mediocrity of the world.

Furthermore, there are many people who were born in a extremely poor region, yet they became successful persons due to the hard work they constantly showed and the multiple failures they have experienced, that helped them work harder on specific goals, and that have made an enormous impact in many young minds since it exposes how someone could be able to achieved anything they are expecting, if you keep trying. If individuals were to give up in the first try, we would be a world with ignorant in it.

Moreover, It is psychological proven that a brain can effectively works in better conditions, if they seem to be in a place where failure could be the main issue. We, as humans tend to follow other's behavior to feel accepted by society. If we keep encouraging people to practice resilience, they would most likely be able to manage every hard situation in life and would have the courage to keep trying even if they are aware they might fail, in other words, they would be practicing negative reinforcement that is based on failing but being aware they could have rewards at the end.

Overall, Failure plays an essential role in the pursuit of success since it gives individuals the challenge of becoming better human being and achieving their goals regardless to the situation. It exposes how human behavior react with the idea that success is not only one extraordinary idea. Success means being able to manage the situation with resilience and perseverance even if they seem to have made multiple mistakes. It influences in many adolescences, gives the hope of being able to achieved their expected accomplishments and it provides higher knowledge from their mistakes. A successful person is the one who have seem to dedicated their time to be able to greatly achieved their dreams. ",485

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Nick D'Alto goes into great depth about how a new computer system, Facial Action Coding Sytem, can revolutionize multiple industries. He began to describe the famous Mona Lisa drawing and how they were able to calculate her facial expressions with the new facial recognition system. He then broadens the topic by explaining how the computer system actually works. After going into even greater detail about the computer process, he begins to describe the many benefits that the Facial Action Coding System will bring. After reading this article, one can agree that the Facial Action Coding System should be implemented into classrooms to read student's emotional expressions for various reasons.

First of all, the use of Facial Action Coding System could enhance the education levels being taught in classrooms by individually designing lessons for students. At one point in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Prof. Thomas Huang states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto 6). By modifying the lesson to the students' needs, this can improve testing scores in classrooms, ensuring that most students will easily learn more based on their facial expressions.

Secondly, the Facial Action Coding System can help with discipline areas among schools. In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Prof. Thomas Huang explains how muscles contribute to a large portion of reading facial expressions. At one point he claims, ""To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity aren't being truthful"" (D'Alto, 8). By pointing the idea out of spotting false facial expressions, the Facial Action Coding System can be used in schools and other places to help detect people who may be lying or trying to hide the truth. Instead of adults trying to pry kids open and ""spill the beans"", they can simply use the computer system to recognize certain facial expressions and then start from there.

Overall, there are many benefits to the Facial Action Coding System, and although some may be more beneficial than others, they each take part in bettering academics and schools in general. By personalizing lessons and helping with disciplinary actions, schools can loosen their grips from a tight load of work on their shoulders and allow the Facial Action Coding System to ""lend a hand"". One can really see how incorporating this system will not only benefit the staff and faculty of schools, but also the many children striving for excellence in academics and character.",432

First, it is clearly obvious that the face only appers as a face because of low resolution cameras and odd shadows, as you can see from the most recent photographs of the rock face. Even in the 1998 picture it is pretty clear that it is not in fact a face but is just a rock formation. The clouds obscure some of the face in the 1998 picture so it might not be conclusive, but the 2001 picture proves it.

Also, if there were alien life of Mars, that would skyrocket NASA's budget to get to Mars because the public would be going crazy and the whole world would want to know. If there were alien life on Mars and NASA was the administration to discover it, the whole world's eyes and wallets would be on them, expecting them to put some men on mars to try to make contact with the Martian life forms, thus winning the race to put astronauts on Mars.

In conclusion, I believe that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a rock formation and nothing more than that. There are clear reasons as to why NASA would want this to be alien life more than anyone, and reasons why they would not keep it a secret from the public.",254

Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War 2. The thought of computers exiting in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronis at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to tablet to acid or heat capabel of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value , not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our tavels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

Drivers should be allowed to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. Drivers may need to use their phones in order to know how to get where they're going. There might also be an emergency in which the driver needs to use his/her phone to call for help. While drivers shouldn't be scrolling through social media while driving, they should be able to use their phones as needed.

Drivers use their phones as a gps device to figure out how to get to their desired location. Studies show that only seven percent of the 220 million cars in the United States have a built in gps navigation system. This means that drivers must find another way to get directions. The maps app on their phone not only gives directions, but it reads the directions out loud so that the driver is not staring at their screen while driving. Using a phone as navigation while driving is the safest alternative to having a built in car gps.

Furthermore, drivers need to use their phones to call for help in the case of an emergency. Emergencies are bound to happen, especially while you're operating a vehicle. Today's technology allows drivers to make calls using limited screen time and/or voice activation. This gives drivers access to using their phones while driving without causing them to take their eyes off the road. Having access to make emergency calls while operating a vehicle can help save the lives of many drivers and their passengers.

Some might argue that drivers should not be allowed to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. However, every driver at one point or another is going to use their phone while driving. Regardless of the reason, it is inevitible. While drivers should not be scrolling through social media and sending texts while behind the wheel, they should have the right to make emergency calls and use gps through their phones. Drivers should be given limited access to their phones while driving.

All in all, drivers should be given the right to use their phones while operating a vehicle. Phones can be used by drivers as a navigation system to help them get places safely. Phones can also be used to make calls in case of emergencies. All things considered, drivers should be allowed to use their phones to a certain extent while driving.

buying video games, and shopping. and looking for technology as a way to communicate which can limit the opportunities to use verbal communication.

I strongly disagree with this statement on the use of technology, because it limits the amount of outside interactions and technology can do everything for you. For example, now people mostly use text as a way to communicate with someone through social media. using only this form of communication can limit the use of verbal communication with a person. Resulting in negative relationships with a person causing misunderstandings and negative relationships. avioding verbal interactions is very bad for somone. Technology can also be damaging for the health.

Technology be both physically and emotionally unhealthy. For Instance the use of so much technology can damage the eyes and can cause brain damage this can result to unhealthy problems in the future. On the other hand people think that by using there phones, tablets and computers. They do not have to be mobile and do a task by themselves with no technology. By sitting around and not getting up to go out and finish a task can lead to loss of energy and many other physical problems. The lack of day to day verbal communication can cause negative emotions. For instance not verbally talking to people can make someone feel lonely and unhappy.

Using technology as a way to purchase things and avoiding to go to the stores can have some negative outcomes. For Example purchasing an electronic on a website and having it delivered it can result to being broken, missing pieces, and can be the wrong thing this can lead to loss of money and can lead to no possible refunds. people use this as way to shop for food, clothes, and books instead of being able to feel the object or know the quality of the item it self or asking an employee about the items pros and cons.

In conclusion, Many people agree that technology allows them to complete many tasks without having to come in contact with others. as a result Technology has a negative impact on people limiting contact with person to person resulting to negative impacts on there day to day life, Although, technology is smart it is always best idea is to be able to do things more off technology and using more verbal communication with a people rather then a phone or computer using verbal communication is a best way to being positive out comes and being able to go to a store instead of relying on technology.

I asked my mother, ""How can I get guys to notice me?"" My mother looked at me puzzled for a few minutes. Later, she responds with, ""Honey, all you have to do is flirt!"" Little did she know, flirting was not in my vocabulary. Soon after, my sister comes into the room, from eavesdropping, and says, ""That's not true, mom! You need to listen to me, sister. All you have to do is be yourself. If a guy doesn't like you for who you are, then they aren't worth your time."" All of a sudden my grandma, who hasn't been out on a date for a while, says, ""Darling, don't listen to them. What you have to do is act dumb. Guys will be chasing your tail if you do that."" Everyone started to bicker back and forth for a while. After gathering all of the advice I got, I started thinking,

""I know what to do!""

Personally, I think getting advice from more than one person has better outcomes. I think it's because with multiple opinions you have more options to choose from, someone may have trouble answering your question, and you may end up finding someone who has more knowledge about your question.

One reason people should seek for advice from more than one person is you have more options to choose from. When I asked my mom for advice, she gave me an answer I wasn't quite comfortable doing. Also, if it wasn't my sister and grandma, I would have been stuck flirting, which is uncomfortable for me. At the end of the day, I had a lot of opinions from different people, and it was my choice to choose the one I feel is better for me. If you don't feel comfortable with an answer, then ask someone else. Doing so, you may be able to get a different outcome. Also, the person you originally asked may have trouble giving you the right answer.

Another reason is the person you originally asked may have trouble giving you the right answer. When I asked my mom for help, she looked at me with a confused face and paused for a long time. I think it was because she never thought of me asking that question before. As a result, she couldn't think of an answer on the spot. She still gave me good advice, but it did seem as if she had trouble answering me. If you ever have someone who can't give you an answer easily, the best choice is to ask someone else. They may have the abilities to give you a well thought out answer. Lastly, another person may have more knowledge about the subject, so they may be able to help you more efficiently.

The last reason is someone may have more experience with the subject you are wanting help with. For example, my sister is in college, and she is taking a social development class. Believe it or not, she learned about the difficulties of confrontation with the opposite gender. In that class, she learned about what not to do when you are talking to a male or female. Which means she knows a lot more about my question then my grandma. My grandma hasn't been out on a date in forty-five years. As a result, she isn't the best person to give advice about talking to boys. In the end, if you want a good answer to a question you have, you should go to multiple people who can help you.

In conclusion, getting advice from more than one person has its rewards. My reasoning is because you have more options to choose from, one person may trouble answering your question, and another person may have more knowledge about your question. Ask someone who has more experience with what you want to know. Also, go to someone you trust, and someone who will give you factual information.

As we migrate towards a world that is more technalized than ever, it is inevitable that technology eventually begin to be able to do human functions such as recognizing emotions. The Facial Action Coding system is a prime example of this with many valuable assets. The use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is valuable in a classroom as it can be used for online lessons, can allow teachers to see how individual students feel about certain topics, and can allow students to connect with online learning.

Online lessons are a amazing example of how valuable this technology can be in classrooms. As Dr. Huang predicted in the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" classroom computers with this technology could moniter a student's emotions and then modify the lesson accordingly. If a student already knew the information and was bored, the computer could detect this and the lesson could move on to something more challenging. If the student was confused, the lesson could go into greater depth in its explanation. The possibilities are endless. This is extremely valuable when it comes to online lessons. Online education is becoming increasingly popular but the problem is, it is hard to modify the lessons based on the student's individual needs as a teacher can when teaching in person and seeing the student's reactions firsthand. This technology would allow teachers to have online lessons in their classroom with the lessons still being fitted to the student's individual needs.

Sometimes it is hard for teachers to gauge how students feel about certain topics. Students are not always honest with how they feel, especially when they need help. This new technology provides the solution to this problem. The computer could monitor the student's emotions during certain lessons on certain topics and then compile this information for the teacher to analyze. Using this data, the teacher could see how each individual kid is feeling about topics and know who is confused and needs more help and who is ready to move on to something harder. The teacher could also see the percentage of the student's emotions as shown in the article. This is priceless for teachers as it allows them to gain undertsanding of their student's emotions towards what they are learning and allows the teacher to act accordingly.

When learning from a physical teacher, students can emotionally connect with them which enables them to feel more comfortable with the material and what they are learning. Computers do not have this. However, with this new facial action recognition technology students would be able to connect with the computer more because they know the computer is recognizing their emotions and acting accordingly. The students would feel understood. Students being able to connect more with online learning is a major development and could ultimately revolutionalize online education.

Critics of this technology may argue that it cannot replace human interaction and the human connection between student and teacher. While this is true, this technology is not aiming to replace this interaction but instead, enrich it. If the teacher is more aware of the student's emotions, the connection can deepen and the teacher can help the student in ways the teacher did not know the student needed help previously. This technology allows education to grow and become more personalized. It is not trying to replace the human interaction and connection of teaching but enable it to grow.

Modifying online lessons based on the student's emotions, teachers having knowledge of how their students feel about topics, and students being able to connect with online learning are all perfect examples of how valuable this technology in classrooms truly is. Some people may argue that technology can not replace human interaction, but that is not what this technology is for. It is for enhancing the connection between students and teachers. This new technology has many assets and many ways that it can be valuably used in a classroom.",670
