When people ask for advise, they sometimes talk to more than one person. There are many advantages for asking multiple people when seeking for advise. Asking multiple people can help a person make a better choice because it helps him or her understand the better options and different possibilities when solving a problem.

Having better options can help a person make a better choice. For example, high school students can ask their teachers or parent about what college to attend. Their parents and teacher might have different opinions on different colleges. As parents, they might want their children to find a college thats closer to them and teachers might give options that relates to the students' high school courses. The high school student can listen to their advises and better decide which college to attend.

People's minds think differently. If a person ask more than one person with a math problem, they might have different ways to solve the problem. It helps the person see the different possibilities of ways to solve the problem. The person can understand the different ways and see which is best for them so that next time they can use that method to find the best answer.

When seeking for advise, it's best to ask multiple people. When asking multiple people, a person can see the different way of solving a problem and it helps them understand the best options. That's why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.",258

Today, almost everyone has a cell phone, especially if they are old enough to drive. Cell phone use while driving has become a big controversy over the last few years and many people have faced the consequences of texting, calling, or searching their cell phones while operating a vehicle. With that being said, there are several reasons why people should not use their phones while driving. These reasons can be classified into a couple of different categories, including safety and legal reasons.

The first reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it can result in injury or death for the driver or someone else. This could pose a safety hazard and would therefore fall under the safety category. Statistically, there are 1.6 million car crashes that are caused by texting and driving each year. Almost 390,000 injuries each year from accidents involve a cell phone or other device. Also, 1 out of every 4 car accidents are caused by texting and driving in the U.S. Therefore, there is always a risk that an accident will happen as a result of cell phone use and could harm anyone involved in the accident.

The second reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it can result in property damage for the driver or someone else, which could pose a safety hazard but could also result in someone pressing charges. Therefore, this could be classified under the safety category and the legal category. As mentioned above, crashes due to cell phone use while driving are very common in the United States. It can cause damage to other vehicles, houses, and or company buildings. Whatever your insurance doesn't cover you have to pay out of pocket and these damages can get really expensive. Any insurance claim could also cause your monthly payments to go up.

The last reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it is against the law in many states such as Georgia, which would fall under the legal category. On July 1, 2018, Georgia passed a Hands-Free law that basically says that anyone driving a motor vehicle on a highway in Georgia is not allowed to hold a phone with any part of their bodies. A first-time offense for using a cell phone and driving is $50, the second is $100, and the third is $150. Each offense after the third one is also $150 each. Every offense is a misdemeanor that would go on your permanent record.

There are multiple reasons why you should not use your phone while driving. This distracted driving can lead to car wrecks that could cause harm to you, to someone in your car, or to anyone else involved in the accident. An accident could also cause damage to your car, to someone else's car, or to homes, buildings, and other property damage. It is also illegal in many other states so if you are caught you could be fined up to $150 and it would go on your permanent record. Because of these potential safety hazards and legal issues, it is best to not use a cell phone while driving a vehicle.",540

It is also a preposturous one. You cannot fully understand what someone is feeling by looking at their face, and attempting to do so is an invasion of their privacy. Facial action coding systems should not be used in classrooms.

The idea that you could fully decipher what someone is feeling based on how they look is absurd. You cannot decide for yourself how someone feels based on the movement of their muscles. For example, if someone looks sad, you cannot just decide that they are sad, just because they look that way. If a machine decides I look confused, does it really have the right to change what I am learning? To understand how someone is really feeling, you have to first ask yourself why they might be feeling that way. Once you understand this, then you can determine what is happening. A machine cannot read minds. If I am confused about one thing, the machine does not know what. Not to mention that people often feel varying emotions at varying times of the day. I might be sad one minute, then laugh at a joke the next. I might not understand something, than understand it in the next second. The machine might automatically change something I understood based on a few seconds of confusion. This is not efficient or helpful.

To read someone's emotions based on their facial expressions is an invasion of their privacy. Let's assume this machine can accurately decipher someone's emotions based on muscle movement. What if you don't want people to know how you're feeling? If I am confused about something, and I am embarrased about it, suddenly the whole word knows. It should be up to the student to decide whether or not they want to seek help, not some magical machine. By forcing students to share private emotions, you run the risk of making them less willing to go to school. Who would want to go to a school where everyone knows how you feel at all times of the day? That would affect learning severely, and would definitely do more harm than good. Hindering learning in an attempt to better understand students is not worth it.

Using this software in classrooms would be ineffective, and even if it did work, it would be a huge invasion of privacy. This software should be used on paintings and nothing more. It is not accurate enough to do anything other than hold back human learning. This software is not fit for classrooms.",435

Do you use your phone while driving? If you said yes, then you need to stop. If you don't then you may end up dead and if you don't believe me then let me tell you some facts. Here is why I don't think people should be able to use their phones while operating a vehicle.

Firstly, driving requires your full attention, but phones compromise this focus. You need to keep both hands on the steering wheel to be the most effective driver. But, every time you text, read messages or talk on a cell phone without a hands-free device, not only is your focus compromised, but you can't keep both hands on the wheel. Phone use when you are driving can also affect your alertness of the surroundings, which can make you prone to collisions. Also, distraction and inattention are the number one cause of traffic accidents and it is estimated that nearly every collision involves one of these two related errors. Driving takes all your attention and it is your responsibility to keep your eyes on the road, so put down the phones and pay attention to the road.

Secondly, people who use a cell phone in the car can drive erratically, which puts others at risk. They may fail to give the proper signals, miss road signs, change lanes abruptly or respond slowly to hazards. Erratic driving patterns can be extremely dangerous to everyone else on the road, including other drivers, pedestrians, and animals. Also, motorist involved in a stressful or emotional phone conversation may exhibit aggressive behavior while they drive, such as road rage. This may cause the erratic driving to worsen and this greatly increases the chance of causing an accident. So, if checking your phone is going to cause you to get mad and drive like you've got no sense and possibly kill someone, then there's no need in even picking it up.

Lastly, there are now legal ramifications when it comes to using phones while driving. You can have criminal penalties placed on you such as fines and tickets and depending on if you had an accident and killed someone you may face more serious criminal consequences such as jail time. Driving with a device can cause you to have higher insurance premiums because insurance rates are tied to a driver's driving history and if you get pulled over for using your phone while driving too many times, it could cause your insurance premiums to spike. Also, you can lose your driving privileges because just like your insurance, you accumulate points for your recklessness. So, if you accumulate too many, you can no longer drive. So, unless your like tickets, fines, jail time, or losing your driver's license, I suggest you wait till you get home to check you phone.

Well there you have it, everything wrong with using your phone while operating a vehicle. Hopefully, you all learned something from this. Hopefully, what you learned was that you shouldn't use your phone while driving. But, if you haven't, that's fine. Just ask yourself a question for me. Is everything you just read worth it for just a minute or two on your phone?",543

I believe that this is cool to have in classrooms and how teachers can teach us how to use this.

The reason why I do want this technology is classrooms is because teachers now can understand what is going through our heads when they are teaching a lesson. They can understand if we aren't getting the information that they are teaching into our heads. They can use this in the furture to better understand how to teach and how to make lessons better. This technology can change the world. This could also help in a school way by artwork like the Mona Lisa. With this technology we can now see her emotion, and with other paintings or artwork just like this. We can now connect to the artist who made it. People all over the world can now understand the artwork.

Another reason why I think we should use emotional expressions is because in the past we really can't know what a person is feeling. You can try and hide it or you can put on a fake smile and everyone believes it. We can use the emotional expressions to prevent sucide. 8th grade to 12th grade, everything is changing your friends, your family, your school, and your teachers. When growing up into a adult life can be very rough. This could help because now we ca see how needs to and how we can help them. In this acticle it says "" classifed six basic emotions. Happiness, surpise, anger, digust, fear and even sadness."" We can get emotions out of that are to scare to come through but are wanting help but dont understand how to. Doctors, and scientists are study even beyond how this works.

In this essay I talked about how an technology such as the emotional expressions can read off emotions. Teachings, changing the way how this could save people's life, and last six basic emotions. The world would change.",345

It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change and I agree with that statement, because it is hard to change people's mind and the way they think about you.

When someone know you or see you for the first time, the way you act, speak or the way you look is what they use to create an idea of how you really are. And when people already have an idea of how you are it is very hard to make them think different. Sometimes when you tell them you are a different person, they won't give you a chance to demostrate if is true, and they will just keep the idea they already have. People who knew you time ago and did not see you again they will keep the idea that they have about you, even if you already change.

Sometimes you meet people in the wrong moment, and they get a bad impression about you. Then they just keep their distance or go away and you can not do anything to change their opinion. First impressions are very hard to change because the majority of people judge you on the first thing they notice about you, it can be your appearence or the way you act.

Although I think first impression are almost impossible to change there are people who thinks that it is not hard to change first impressions , and they may be not wrong also, because there are people who give you an opportunity to start over and show them that you are different; However even if there are some ways you can change the impression that someone has about you, there are more reasons why it is almost impossible to change first impressions.

To conclude first impressions are almost impossible to change and people should be more carefully about first impressions. Because it is very hard to change the way a person thinks. and also it can affect your reputation.                   ",343

We haven't gone there because its atmosphere contains sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide and reaches 870 degrees Fahrenheit. This means that any exploratory vessel would have to be acid and heat-resistant, and that's not cheap.

The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" says we should study Venus even though it is hard. The author says that Venus is similar to Earth and could have been a place where life existed. The atmosphere could be very dangerous for humans but not for robots. The article also says we could study Venus from a distance using telescopes. We could learn about geology, the atmosphere, and how Venus lost its water. 

I think the author does a great job of supporting their claim that we should explore Venus even though it's difficult. They say it's similar to Earth and we could learn things that would help us on Earth and maybe even find life. They also give ideas on ways to do it without putting humans in danger.

In closing, the author provides excellent reasons to study Venus despite the obstacles. They explain why it's important and how we can do it safely.

The Washington Post,

"" 65% of the workers are hard-working and loves their job. ""Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. For example, they look for someone who is responsible and hard-working, and often they look for a person who has experience."" In some countries, start working at age of 15 years old is mandatory, because it helps to young people to obtain new views about different kind of jobs. Everyone has the capacity to be a responsible in their labor, but some people are hard-working because they want to accomplish their goals, and have an excellent record and experience from the last job is so important.

The first reason why is so important to be a hard-working is because you can accomplish your goals. For example, my friend Generic_Name, she started worked when she was 16 years old, she studied and worked at the same time. Generic_Name worked very hard to accomplished her goals. Generic_Name's goals was: be a teacher, buy a house, a car and save money for the College. It was not easy for her, but she was optimistic. She wake up every morning at 6:00 o'clock to go school, and she always fought for have a better future and accomplished her goals. Generic_Name over time get a lot of experience and she inspired others people to do better their jobs. She won a prize for been doing well her job and supported others to inspire to do an extraordinary job. Working hard is the best way to demonstrate you can work in any place and loves your job.

The second reason is when you are working is important to leave an excellent record, because it help to develop a good characteristics and experience. In some jobs, they call to ask for details about if the person have an excellent record and experience. Furthermore, my uncle Generic_Name, he just moved from New York to California, and he was looking for a new job. Generic_Name worked as an engineer in

Village's Company

. He was doing well his job in New York, but he needed moved. He went to apply in this new place, and the employers called to Village's Company asking for details about how he was doing his job when he was working for them, and then Village's Company says ""Generic_Name was one our best worker we had, he was responsible and he have the knowledge about his job."" The new company hired my uncle because he leave an excellent record. Hiring a person who has experience is important, because it help to develop better a job. Some people may argue that be a responsible and hard-working is not necessary in a job. However, be responsible is so important, because people are getting more experience and more capacity to do their labor. Some people do not like to follow the rules when they are in their jobs.

In conclusion, we can not change the entire world, but start been responsible and working hard in our jobs is beneficial, because it is the place where we can inspire others to do their jobs well and any company will hire us for been excellent workers. Every labor is admirable, and we can care our jobs because it depends we can accomplish any goal we has in our life. We can show a lot characters in our work such as: be respecfull, be on time, and the most important things is love our jobs.",597

I believe students should participate in extracurricular activities because one it keep them out of trouble, two some of the activities keep them healthy, and three they are fun.

One reason students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they keep most students out of trouble. For example, it can keep the students occupied so they don't have to be on the streets. Another example is sometimes these activities can help them relax and keep them calm so they stay out of trouble.

Another reason is some of the activities can keep them healthy. For example students can do football or basketball which keeps them running and keeps them in good shape. They can also do lift training after school which keep them fit and all around healthy.

Last but not least these activities are fun. There are always a lot of activities and you can always find something you like. For example if you like sports there are so many different sports you can do. There are also other things like drama club if you like acting, art club if you like drawing, even robotics club if you like technology and stuff like that.

Therefore these are the reasons I agree that all students should do at least one extracurricular activity.",218

There is a lot of benefits of having a positive attitude which are health or physical improvements, how to solve a problem, and the power that exists inside you.

The benefits of optimism extend beyond stress relief better health, more rewarding relationships and enhanced productivity. People with a positive outlook tend to experience are reduced incidence of depression, lower stress levels and are better able to cope with stress causing events, an incresed life span and overall better health. People with a positive outlook on life are also more likely to live healthier lifestyle, and to smoke cigarattes less and drink less alcohol.

Attitude is the way taht we behave and we react to the daily activities, consequently a positive attitude may influence our life and it aspects in a deep way such as how we think, socialize, and even how our health is. All these aspects might be affected by a positive attitude. Actually it is proved that successful people have been influenced by the way they see the circumtances in their life. In other words, successful people see those circumtances with a positive attitude and they see those circumtances as a challange to beat and not like a punishment to suffer. Therefore, these people will be more likely to fight and have success in their life, rather than the ones who see their life as a punishment. Positive attitude might be the key to all the people who want to fulfill their dreams. If everyone would apply these concepts in their lives, they would become happier because they will see that everything including their life, situations, and problems, is under their own control.

Even though there are some people who wonder how to get a good positive attitude, is not simple to get it. Almost every single person that has has a positive attitude is because tehy have had a motivation or a feeling that supports their fight to reach their goal or achievement. When you have a positive attitude, you feel that there is a power inside of you that motivates you to do something or to get involved with something. These people are most commons to have best attitudes of this world.

Having a positive attitude can lead you to the lighter, braver and stronger way to stand against negative attitude.          ",400

This is because you have a better chance to get the right opinion, then the wrong opinion. Also my personal preference is to get everybody's opinion before doing something that will impact me. For example, one day I was very sick and asked if I should go to school or not my mom and my sister told me to go to school.

Another reason is that if you really want to do something that's not right you can get some other opinion's and see if you should do it or not. Like if your going to do something bad your friends or family can talk you out of doing it. There was one time that I really wanted to do something, but I knew it was not the right thing to do, I told my family about it and they talked to me about it. They said it was not right to do so I didnt do it, even know you really wanted to do it.

The only negative to multiple advise is that, you could get completely different answers then everyone else. If you had to pick something out from the store and your friend says to go buy candy and your over friend says go buy soda you don't know what to get so you are left confused and don't know what to buy. this problem could be solved if you just asked one person what to buy not mutable people.

Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. I strongly disagree with this prompt because once we enter high school we are transitioning to a bigger school with more new subjects that catches our attention. My reasons for disagreeing is that I was once a rising ninth grader and I would be unhappy with the career I wanted in my freshman year. For example when I first came into high school as a ninth grader I wasn't sure of what I wanted to be once I graduate. Now I am a senior at Generic_school and I have two option to choose from.

In my perspective I believe that at a young age mindset changes; you find new interest in things and also our mind isn't fully developed at ages fourteen or fifth teen; we aren't mature wisely on what we want. I think the student should started preparing them self once they're in junior year which is when they're a eleventh grader. My reason for saying that is because you're close to graduating and need to start planning your future, looking for scholarship, and making sure you want the career you've chosen for a long period of time.

I don't think its a bad idea but i wouldn't agree with it because I know how this generation is like and we need more teacher to start talking to them seriously about life after high school. These past year a huge amount of student have dropped out of school because they do not feel like they have support from teacher, friends, or even their own parents; or maybe the student think they can't afford college; not many teacher talk to them about financial help or support.",310

Lately there's been a problem regarding electoral colleges. Some people are in favor of them; others not so much. I agree with the latter; electoral colleges are anachronistic and should no longer be used in this day and age.

In this modern era, people are being more aware or more educated about the going-ons in government. As a result, it is becoming no longer necessary to have others vote in place of the people's choices. Instead, people should be able to vote directly for their chosen leaders and not have to worry about an elector making a last minute decision to vote for another.

Those who are in favor of electoral colleges are wrong about keeping them. In only half-way allowing people to vote for president, it could also be viewed that the people were never really given a choice. Their votes are at the mercy of the electors.

If you are wise Mr. Senator, you'll choose to do away with electoral colleges. By doing so, you give people more choice and control over their decisions. I hope you'll put your foot down on this matter and refuse to have anything to do with electoral colleges because they're not helping the future of our country,

In the realm of arguing weather the use of emotional recognition technology should be used in a classroom can be a very difficult tquestion. On one side, you can say it may invade privacy, but on the other hand, it could help teachers see if students are understanding the topic. The question still lies on which one is more important for both the student and the teacher. In my opinion, this technology should be implemented into classrooms internationally because it will help students learn more effectivley, but also it will enhance the teachers teaching ability when they know where they're students are going array.

This technology could be very benificial for students across the globe. The ability for a piece of technology to understand your emotions could come in handy. There are many outgoing students, but there are also many introverted students. Some students may not feel confident enough to ask for something to be repeated, so they may simply sit at their desks puzzeled for the rest of the class, while a simple question could've avoided this. If this technology is instituted, it will automatically know when a student isn't confident on the information and alert the teacher. By doing this, the introverted student won't be confused for very long and the topic could be revisited without the student to have to personally ask. It not only will help introverted students, but students across the board. Every student will benifit form this technology and will display in their grades. With this technology, the students acedemic achievements will expand exponentially. Becuase of this ability for teachers to understand their emotions, the quick turn around of revisiting the topic and teaching it a little differently could help the students absorb all the information, especially the information that they mau have not conprehended initally. This technology will be very valuable for the students for both their enjoyment throughout school becuase of the reduced stress, and their improvents in acedemic grades.

This technology is not only bennifical to the students, but to the teacher as well. For the teacher they will automatically know if a student is struggling and in what topic. Thius could be very valuable to create a strong teacher studnent realtionship where the teacher is able to understant the smallest change in emotion to when they're confused or if they understamd it. This relationship could improving the learning environment and how comfortable a student with their students and peers. This technology could help teachers in both big and small schools. In big lecture halls, it may seem to be difficult for a professor to understand the emotions of all the students sitting before them, they might not even be able to see everyone because some may sit further away. With this new technology, teachers could be notified when some students become confused and then revisit a topic. Small classrooms could benifit greatly to this as well. Althought they are in a closer proximity then in lecture halls, they still will have the issue of not understanding the emotions which could lead to confusion. In smaller classrooms the teacher could know what they're doing wrong and be able to fix this easily without having to disturb the students. They can evaluate the emotions throughout the lesson and then later, they can change their lesson plans to adapt to the confusion of the students. This is again, a very valuable piece of technology that could help the teachers grow in their profession.

Initally one may think that this technology is redundant and that a teacher could just help the student, and that it may be invading the students privacy. In reality, this technology continues to prove its many values, and it's evergrowing amount of benifits that completly overpower all the ideas that some may think its unnimportant. This technology is valuable to both teachers and students equally. The teachers are able to improve their teaching techniques and the students understand more in school. This technology, however, is nowhere near done. This technology can be further improved in many aspects. I could keep improving and always creating a smarter version of the present day technology, that may one day, change the course of education forever. This could be implemented in the online schools to understand if a student comprehends the information the value of this is unspeakable and should be institued in classrooms globally.",751

The election is used to decide who our president will be for the next four years. The Electoral College is currently being used for our elections. The articles ""Does the Electoral College Work?"" and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard Posner believes the Electoral College should continue to stay in use. On the other hand, the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer believes that the Electoral College should be removed from the system of electing the President. While the Electoral College has been in use for a majority of the time, it is time to start a different process called popular vote.

The Electoral College has been in place for many years and has produced good results. One good thing the Electoral College does is it prevents a candidate from becoming President if they only have regional appeal. This is crucial because ""a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president"" Posner. With the Electoral College in place it makes it impossible to for a candidate with only regional appeal to become president because no region has enough electoral votes to elect them. Another helpful thing the Electoral College does is it has a certainty of outcome, so it is less likely for disputes than popular votes. It is less likely for disputes because ""the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"" Posner. Even if a state has a few more votes for the Electoral College it still creates a huge victory. Even though the Electoral College has produces some good results, presidents being elected through popular vote will be better, more efficient, and more equal.

Again, the popular vote will be more fair. It will be more fair because a president with more popular votes will win. In the Electoral College, a candidate with the most popular votes does not ensure victory because the other candidate may have more electoral votes. This happened in 2000 when Al Gore got more popular votes, but lost the presidency Plumer. The Electoral College is not fair to the citizens of this country and to the candidates. If more people prefer one candidate over the other, then the president should clearly clearly be them. The Electoral College is also not fair because if there is a tie, then the vote goes to the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives' ""selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people"" Plumer. The majority of the House of Representatives is Republicans, so the president elected will be reflected by that, and it will not give the Democrats equal representation. All in all, popular vote should be used to determine the President because it is a more fair and an equal way to do so.

Equally important, popular vote should be used to elect the President because then candidates and voters will pay attention to the campaign. With the Electoral College candidates only spend time trying to win the votes of the ""swing states."" They will not pay attention to the states that they already know have their vote. In fact, in the 2000 campaign, there were seventeen states that the candidates never visited. Two of those are Rhode Island and South Carolina Plumer. Every state should be able to see the candidates so the voters get to really know who they are voting for, so they will make a better decision. Also, with the Electoral College people in states that know their vote will not matter will not pay attention to the campaign. A person such as, a ""Republican in California... have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote"" Posner. Everyones opinion should matter and should be taken into account when electing the President. To summarize, popular vote is the only way to ensure that the voters get all the knowledge they need to elect the President, and so that everyone's vote matters.

In conclusion, electing the President is a painstaking task and should be done using popular vote, not the Electoral College. The President of the United States plays an important role in our country. The President has to make many difficult decisions, and those decisions should be a reflection of the entire country. It should not just reflect the certain states that contributed their electoral vote.",763

Some of my friends perform community service, but my other friends think it just waste of time. I am supporting that the principal should require students to perform community service. This is a great way to show to the community that you care. Students should know that community service is very important. Community service helps you and your community.

There are many reasons why students should perform community service. Performing community service helps your community and other communities. Your community will be cleaner and fresh. Not just students but everyone in this country should have community service. When your community is full with trash. No one will care, but you can make a change. You will need a helping hand to help you with community service.

In streets, public places, and school campus, there are people littering. If you care about your community, you should gather people to help you clean it. Even if the trash is not yours, pick it up. It is not just picking up trash. There are planting trees, etc. So, when you are done picking up the trash, you could continue planting trees and flowers. To make it stand out.

Why does a student's education matter? To me, it is extremely important because it can affect them for their entire life in positive or in negative ways. It could lead them to a job with a seven figure salary, or to work a part-time job at a fast food restaurant making minimum wage. What's also important to me is the learning experience. I believe learning should be fun, interesting, and not stressful for students. That's why I agree with the school board's plan to extend the school day by one and a half hours, because that way, students wouldn't feel rushed and would have more time to learn, teacher will have more time to teach and using new ways, and the school year would be a little shorter.

To begin with, I agree with the school board to extend the school day because students wouldn't feel rushed and they would have more time to learn. Right now, each of our periods are only about 50 minutes, which I think really isn't a lot of time to learn once you start working. If one and a half hours is added to the current school day, we would have at least an hour for each class. This way, the students would have more time to complete projects, assignments, or just have more time to really understand the subject without feeling rushed. I know this because right now, I am working on a project in science class that we only have two class periods to finish, which totals for just about one and a half hours! I am not saying that a little push isn't necessary or beneficial, but the extra time would definitely boost the quality of the student's work at our school without rushing them.

Secondly, I think the school board should increase the school day by one and a half hours because that will let teachers have more time to teach, while using unique ways to do so. With the students having more time to learn, the teachers could potentially also have more time to actually create a better learning experience. Extending the day ensures that teachers would be able to thoroughly explain new concepts and materials, while also teaching using better or more effective methods that wouldn't have been possible because of the shortage of time. For instance, sometimes we have educational scavenger hunts, where the teacher lays the information throughout the campus and we would have to find them. The issue is, we've never been able to finish, not because it wasn't possible to, but because there simply wasn't enough time. Those kinds of educational activities are, in my opinion, very fun, but it's also effective. So if we have more time, I am sure that some teachers would plan and teach more using different ways which are beneficial to both the student and the teacher.

Lastly, the school board's plan to extend one and a half hours to the school day is something I strongly concur with because school will be out earlier in the summer. While I do enjoy school very much, I think summer break is something that everyone looks forward to. The days that are cut down because of the increased time allows students to attend more activities and spend more time together with their families. Even though the students aren't at school, they could still be learning something new on their own. For example, they could be learning how to play an instrument, training for sports, or learning how to speak another language, which are all very helpful for them. Also, the teachers could be attending conferences which let's them collaborate with other teachers on creating newer and more efficient methods to teach, which will help everyone in the long run.

In conclusion, the reasons why I agree with the school board to extend the hours are because students wouldn't feel rushed, teachers would have more time to teach in unique ways, and school will be out sooner in the summer. Although I think there are many more reasons why the school day should be longer, those are the main ones. There are just so many benefits that this extended time would create; possibly having an effect on the entire community. This is not an immense amount of change but it can be a big success, which is why I think you should really consider extending the school hours.

Sincerely,

The technology can detect how you are feeling, in the passage it tells you that the computer can tell if a human is mad, happy, sad, worried, etc.

This technology can be very useful to techers as well as anyone else. If a student is feeling a lot of emotion and trying to do school work, they will be more focused on what they were feeling instead of the work the teacher has given him/her. It can also help the teacher to know how exactly to act twards a student. For example, if a student is feeling 75% sad they are most likely going to cry. If a student is about to cry and teacher starts yeling at them for not paying attention, because the student isn't feeling like themselves that day its going to trigger the students brain to make them cry.

In conclusion, this tehcnology in my opinion should most defiently be used in schools. Not only to help the teachers out, but for the stundents themelves. I think that if we use this technology it will increase focuse on school work will improve moods, and increase better grades and testing scores.",206

This is a question that has several answers varying from personal health, to economic gain, to environmental gain. Though the car has been the symbol of the modern age, there seem to be few downsides to limiting the usage of these transportation units.

Cars have given mankind the ability to cross great distances in a short amount of time, allowing face to face communication, fast trade between companies and nations, and access to medical and personal care otherwise out of reach. However, the car has also caused lack of mobility, cutting back on people's exercise as they no longer have to walk very far to get from point A to point B, the overwhelming responsibility and cost of owning a car has also put a mental strain on people, causing needless stress. Of course there are places to go and things to do that require traveling large distances, and no one could be a expected to walk from New York to L.A., so car usage should not be utterly removed, but rather restricted.

So how do people properly regulate their car usage? Several different governments and cities have debated this, trying different tactics and having varied results. As shown in Elisabeth Rosenthal's essay, ""In German Suburbs, Life Goes On Without Cars"" , we are shown the result of a community where 70% of the people do not own cars, but with no less activity than their counterparts in cities weighed down by cars. There seem to be several advantages in this city without cars, one being that people seem to be happier. Heidun Walter, a media trainer with two children informed Rosenthal, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"", the lack of cars seems to reduce stress, without restricting life.

So perhaps this is not enough reason for some to limit their usage of the car, alright, there are many more reasons why this is beneficial. One that is quite familiar to all is the issue of greenhouse gas emissions. The majority of cars produce greenhouse gas emissions, polluting the environment and quickening the death of the planet, Rosenthal's essay "" In German Suburbs, Life Goes On Without Cars, "", we are told clearly that, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gass emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. "" This may seem like very little, but with the amount of cars in the world, these numbers add up to staggering damage to the environment. Robert Duffer wrote an essay telling of these harmful effects in a shocking way: "" "". This city had so much pollution that they had to ban the use of cars, ""Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London,"". This pollution is not only in France, but across the globe, it is only a matter of time before it destroys the ecosystems on Earth, and cars are one of the biggest contributers to this destruction, coming in second only to power plants.

One Colombian city chose not to wait until such things happened, instead choosing to promote limited car usage in a more peacful manner, as described by Andrew Selsky's essay, "" Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota "". This city of 7 million people started a program that chooses one day a year to bann all car usage with the exception of buses and taxis, fining violators with 25. One main benefit has come out of this: People are more active phisically and therefore have less stress. Selsky's essay can be quoted saying, "" millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday,"". The benefits of more physical movement are obvious, but one is not so obvious: It lowers stress. A businessman by the name of Carlos Arturo Plaza said, ""It is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". If a simple day can cause such drastic changes in the environment, peoples health, and lower stress, why not go ahead and do it?

In summary, while cars help us get from point A to point B quickly, and are very useful when traveling over great distance, they also cause great harm. A simple cut back on using cars would allow the air pollution to be reduced drastically, promote physical movement and personal health, and help productivity and creativity by reducing stress.",762

Seeking different people's opinions allows you to get all the information from all sides. If people seek more than one person's advice then you would be able to compare the information to see what you think is the best choice. Also, if people seek more than one person's advice then the person might be able to collect all the information and put it together.

Another reason people ask different people is because the first person may not be giving you the best advice. Like, what if the first person's advice is pretty good, but then the next person you ask has better advice. If the person asked advice from more than one person then you wouldn't have to be stuck with the bad information. If you just ask for one person's advice and it was bad advice then it could get you in really big trouble. Like, if you rely on one person's advice and they told you that if they start making you mad then you can put your hands on them. What if the person you put hands on presses charges then you could go to jail for a long time. If you asked another person's opinion then you may not be in the situation that you are in.

The next reason why people ask different people for adivce is because if the advice the person gave you worked for them, but it didn't work for you. Like, if a person is having trouble with their dog alerting them that they need to use the restroom. So that their dog doesn't keep going to the restroom in the house. They might say ""you could give your dog a treat when they alert you they need to go to the restroom"". If that doesn't work, but you only asked one person for advice. Then, you would be mad because the advice didn't work. Next, you would have to ask another person for advice, but at the beginning if you would have just asked more than one person then you would be able to peice the information together.

Finally, if people ask more than one person's advice then it will help you make the best choice possible.",385

One of the reasons were for research purposes. I was able to use technology as a tool to provide information on my assignments and projects. So far technology has made a positive effect in my life not only in school but in real life. Technology has helped me accomplish and complete many difficult task in life. I believe that technology has made a positive effect on people's lives; consequently, it makes peoples lives a lot easier and convenient.

One reason that technology has a positive effect on people is that they are able to study without having to go out on a library and pay for books or a tutor to teach them. For example, people who are disabled or unable to travel out of their houses are able to go online and research for books and look for a site to teach them what they need to learn. The availability to go online and research for information also helps students who are too busy to go outside and ask others for help. Many schools started providing laptops and iPad's to students who are unable to connect online. Schools are using these electronics because they provide an easier way to help student learn and complete work.

Technology can also help people do many other things online other than researching for information.

Furthermore, technology may also be used as a way to shop whatever and whenever. For example, eBay and amazon is an online shopping website for many things such as: furniture, clothes, food, and many other reliable things. This has made it a lot easier for people to purchase items that they want at any time. Online shopping helps a lot of people who are looking for items that cannot be found in local stores. For example, many custom equipment's and items can only be found online and in places that may not even be located in your place. Not only does technology may be use as an online tool, it may also used as a way to communicate to others in the world.

Lastly, communication has been a major part of the world; in addition, technology has been one of their ways to communicate. For example, our military has improved a lot throughout the years due to the inventions of many technologies. Technologies such as: cellular devices, radar, satellite and many other communicating tools has helped us win wars and accomplish many things around the world. Another reason why technology has had a positive effect on people is that they use it for emergency purposes. For example, if an adult needs to call out of work for the day because of family problems, he may use his cellular device to call and inform his supervisor about it.

Many people say that technology is a way to showcase yourself as a lazy person and I disagree with that. I believe that technology allowed many people to accomplish and complete many task. Technology is not only important to the civilians who are either students or adults who are working in the industry, but it is also important for the military who are using these tools to provide protection to our country and keep our people safe. In conclusion, technology has had a positive effect on people's lives and that is due to many reasons such as online researching, online shopping, and wide spread communication.                 ",580

There are many reasons why it can be seen as valuable. For example, students would stay on task longer and may even look forward to lessons. Who knows, maybe it could even change their outlook on school.

If we had this kind of technology, students would be able to work so much more efficiently. There are so many times when I see other students around me struggling with different kinds of activities and lessons. Not every student is the same, so you can't expect all students to score perfect on the same assignments. In paragraph six, Dr. Haung states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This point could also help teachers connect and understand with each individual student better.

I wish we had this kind of technology at my school. I feel like if we did, I'd be able to understand many more of the concepts my teahcers are teaching. Using the Facial Action Coding System could be extremely beneficial to schools around the world.",200

For example, a boy is challenged with the option of running for the highest leadership in his community. What shall he do to make sure that he is making the right choice? To put it simply, your average boy next door has the opportunity to be a youth leader in his community. With natural leadership skills, his parents have no doubt that we would make a good leader, but doubt still seems to be a deciding factor. Our boy is faced with doubt and overwhelming uncertainty of his options. With so much going on, he has no idea of what he should, and can do. Would you, as his neighbor help him? When people have a decision to make, consulting more than one person can oftentimes lead to the better choice. Sometimes, others can have more knowledge than you, and therefore would be a better source. Others, especially adults with more experience can even tell you possible outcomes of your decision. Seeking advice from people with experience, knowledge, and wisdom can help you make the right decision.

More than one set of eyes on a topic can be a good thing sometimes. With more people reviewing your choices they could catch mistakes, or even tell you what you could do to improve your idea or choice. For example, when I wanted to buy a new camera, I was torn between so many different options. After asking my parents, friends, and family, I finally made the best choice for my money. Even when you have a small decision to make, like what to buy for lunch, asking your friends could help you get the best option they have to offer. Even when the President is making decisions, he too has people he can ask for advice. No matter what choice or decision you have to make, asking others for advice is a healthy option.

When others have more knowledge than you, their opinions and advice can be more in depth, practiced, or even more intelligent. To put it into perspective, if you have a question on math homework, asking the teacher would be more beneficial that asking your peer, or table mate. If you want to switch classes, or change your schedule, asking a counselor, or teacher with more knowledge than you can help you make the right decision too. Even when a high school student is applying to college, they too would ask their parents for advice. Using other's experienced advice, older knowledge and wisdom can lead you down the road to the right choice.

When making a big decision, sometimes asking somebody who has done such a thing before can tell you the outcome, or give you experienced advice. If a girl wants to get contacts, she could ask her parents, family members, or teachers who have had contacts before for advice. They themselves have had it before, so they would know the outcome, and therefore would be a great resource for advice. I know that when I wanted to go to summer camp, I asked my teacher who had been there before. She knew what it was like, and could tell me all about it so I knew I was making the right decision. Even when an aspiring actor or singer wants to join the industry, they too ask those who have gone through the same process for advice, or what to expect as an outcome. Asking those with experience, or previous knowledge can not only help you make the right choice, but also tell you about an outcome that the choice might provide.

Seeking advice from people with experience, knowledge, and wisdom can most definitely help you make the right decision. So, would you help the boy next door? If you have been through what he is experiencing, would you offer him advice? It can be tough to find people, but more than one person reviewing a topic or choice can help someone make the right decision. Having other people review your decision, or asking multiple sources can sometimes help you make the right choice. Even asking more experienced individuals can help too. When asking someone who has more in-depth knowledge, or is wiser, you can receive advice that you wouldn't have thought of. Even when making a big decision, like our boy next door, you can ask people who have done such things before. When asking those who have experienced first hand the choices you want to make, you can get opinions or advice from more experienced individuals. When you ask others for help, advice, or opinions, you have the chance to dive into a world of possibilities. When asking more than one person, you can experience even more possibilities. Asking other can give you the best help you may ever receive.",812

One reason is that schools shouldn't allow anyone to put that technology into their computers because that technology has nothing to do with school or what the kids are learning at school. Another reason is that the way people feel is how they feel, it's not meant for the whole world, the school, or anyone to know how they are feeling if they didn't tell that person. If that person didn't tell anyone that's because they wanted to keep what was wrong with them to their self.

In paragraph three it says that the Facial Action Coding System that is enable in computers can tell if a human is feeling happy, surprise, angry, disgust, fear, and sadness. If a student is feeling happy or surprise its okay for people to know, but when a sudent is feeling angry, disgust, fear, and sad it's not because you don't know what that person is going through or how that person is living.

This technology that someone came up with is not a good idea. I said it's not because I wouldn't want anyone to know how i'm feeling if i'm not in a good mood. If i'm angry or sad about something I would keep it to myself and not tell anybody because I wouldn't people to kee bringing it up to me when i'm trying to forget about it.",304

Cars come in a variety of colors and shapes. The thing about cars that you probably didn't know is that they pollute. Polluting is a very bad thing, everyday we're breathing in chemicals from cars that pollute. Doesn't sound very good now, does it? Cars are extreamly expensive too!

Cars cost thousands of dollars. Now, lets think for a minute, what if you didn't have a car? You wouldn't be able to get to places fast enough, you won't be on time to where you are trying to go. Well, you see, there are things called bikes and buses. It might not be as fast but, you'll still get there. Their are a lot of advantages of not having a car. You don't have to pay for insurance, You don't have to worry about accidents, You also don't have to worry about polluting the environment. In Vauban, Germany many people do not own cars. Atleast 70% of them do not own cars. Did you know that about 57% of the people in Vauban, Germany sold there cars so they could move to Germany?

In Paris, people enforced a partial driving ban to clear out some of the pollution. If you drove in your car you would have to pay a $31.00 dollar fee. That day, about 4 thousand drivers were fined. Wow! that is a lot of people to be fined for driving. Is it easy for you to imagine a car-free zone, where nobody is driving, and the roads are free of cars? Believe it or not, a lot of people like the idea of a car-free zone. In Columbia, people had banned cars for 3 straight years! Now, that is a long time to not be able to use a car. There was still transportation of course such as, biking, roller skating, walking, and even buses. I mean, you can't walk every where, right?

Even when it rained the people still didn't use cars, and it rained a lot. Not having a car takes away the pollution of the air and stress because, I can imagine having a car would be stressfull due to money you have to pay for gas and insurance. Their was about 118 miles of biking paths that people could take to get around. Stores were moved to be closer to people so they wouldn't have to travel so far. As each year goes by, americans are driving less, buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses. I guess it's suggested that we don't use cars as much due to air pollution but i dont thing that is going to stop everyone in the world from driving their cars. I think we should cut down on driving every where and maybe car pool instead or take a bus, that way not everyone is driving and there will be less pollution. People will of course still drive cars and cars will pollute the air but, it is not going to stop us from driving.",520

In this essay i will argue that keeping yourself busy serves a purpose. You get more things done, you will not be considered lazy and you get to learn new things.

When you are always doing something you get more things done and out of the way. You will not be behind on anything. This is a good habit to have because it can affect you in the long run. For example, when you get older and have to pay taxes or bills. You will be caught up and on time which is really good for your credit score.

You will not be considered lazy. Many people in your life will notice how you like to get things done. This habit will definitely get you a job. No employer is looking for someone lazy and does not like to do things. Keeping yourself busy can be therapeutic. Many people do this to relive stress or think about things instead of being useless.

You will learn new things. Take advantage of the things you do because it can lead you to new opportunities. You can experience different things which is phenomenal. It is always fun keeping yourself busy because you feel great after the things you have accomplished. The more things you learn the more things you can try to keep yourself busy.

Some people say inactivity serves a purpose, but they are wrong because when you are always doing something it keeps you motivated, experienced and makes a good habit to have. In the future I hope we have less useless people and more people who like to get things done.  ",281

There are well over 100 ads on television that ties to better technology. These ads are to prompt customers into buying the latest devices such as the latest computer, mac pad, the IPHONE X, the smart phone that is as thin as a piece of paper, and the widest, flattest television screen. There is something that all of these devices do not have. Now a new system called the Facial Action Coding System is reaching the surface. This system allows computers to dictate how a person is feeling by just their facial expressions such as muscle placemnts in their face, the rise and fall of cheeks and under eyelids. So is this new system valuable, and can it be beneficial to our community?

This system is beneficial to our school communities. According to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto its says "" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr. Hauang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructure."" If computers were able to see how many kids were and were not ingaged in the activity that takes place on computers, then it would help the schools and the state to know what new things to try to keep kids ingaged so they can get the best possible education offered to them. This system is great for Istep test taking as well. Sometimes kids may fall asleep during testing or they may start too dose off and not be as consentrated as they should, and that could have a negative affect on their test. If the computer could read their emotions it would help us to know what the problem is and the reason why kids are losing focus and once we have confronted the problem we can then began the process of finding an affective solution.

This computer would be very beneficial in offices and in police stations. They could be used to help with criminal justice. A suspect can be told to tell their side of the story infront of a computer screen and the computer would be able to dictate that persons true emotions. This could make the officer, and investigaters job alot easier. They could be used in hospitals to keep an eye on how a paitent is feeling maybe after a recovery or when they are lying on their death bed. In the article it says "" They even can indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" So there is no faking of emotions out of a crime. Its also says "" In a false smile, the mouth is stretched sidways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" There is no faking with that computer.

This new system has the ability to make our jobs alot easier. Nowadays people dont usually communicate face to face anymore. That means people dont usually express theirselves in person as much as they once did in earlier days when technology wasnt around. So this can be a way to still be able to know how someone is feeling, esspecially if they are less likely to tell how they are feeling when your right infront of them. This can be very effective with younger kids who may not know how to epress how they may be feeling in the right way, shape, or form. This new system gives us a new way to still connect with our community. This new system is a pathway to a brighter future. This new system is valuable to our community.",607

I can infer that the mentioned statement Prime Minister Winston had provided has an strong point of view from many perspectives. Human behavior mostly influences in their achievements and failures throughout life. To be able to achieved your expected goals without loosing enthusiasm, and demonstrating resilience is the greatest accomplishment. I strongly agree with the Churchill's statement regardless to the critical role failure plays in life. It gives the enthusiasm every individuals need in order to be successful in life, it motivates young minds to follow their expectations, and provides more knowledge in many cases since we learn from our mistakes.

Accordingly to many researches, individuals tend to give up when they are facing an obstacle in a complicated occasion, that prevented most of society to stop achieving their accomplishments due to the constant fear of experiencing failure. Society has been exacerbating this concept by creating irrational fear in those who are not willing to take risks to become better persons once they seemed to have failed, which leads to the mediocrity of the world.

Furthermore, there are many people who were born in a extremely poor region, yet they became successful persons due to the hard work they constantly showed and the multiple failures they have experienced, that helped them work harder on specific goals, and that have made an enormous impact in many young minds since it exposes how someone could be able to achieved anything they are expecting, if you keep trying. If individuals were to give up in the first try, we would be a world with ignorant in it.

Moreover, It is psychological proven that a brain can effectively works in better conditions, if they seem to be in a place where failure could be the main issue. We, as humans tend to follow other's behavior to feel accepted by society. If we keep encouraging people to practice resilience, they would most likely be able to manage every hard situation in life and would have the courage to keep trying even if they are aware they might fail, in other words, they would be practicing negative reinforcement that is based on failing but being aware they could have rewards at the end.

Overall, Failure plays an essential role in the pursuit of success since it gives individuals the challenge of becoming better human being and achieving their goals regardless to the situation. It exposes how human behavior react with the idea that success is not only one extraordinary idea. Success means being able to manage the situation with resilience and perseverance even if they seem to have made multiple mistakes. It influences in many adolescences, gives the hope of being able to achieved their expected accomplishments and it provides higher knowledge from their mistakes. A successful person is the one who have seem to dedicated their time to be able to greatly achieved their dreams. ",485

As we migrate towards a world that is more technalized than ever, it is inevitable that technology eventually begin to be able to do human functions such as recognizing emotions. The Facial Action Coding system is a prime example of this with many valuable assets. The use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is valuable in a classroom as it can be used for online lessons, can allow teachers to see how individual students feel about certain topics, and can allow students to connect with online learning.

Online lessons are a amazing example of how valuable this technology can be in classrooms. As Dr. Huang predicted in the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" classroom computers with this technology could moniter a student's emotions and then modify the lesson accordingly. If a student already knew the information and was bored, the computer could detect this and the lesson could move on to something more challenging. If the student was confused, the lesson could go into greater depth in its explanation. The possibilities are endless. This is extremely valuable when it comes to online lessons. Online education is becoming increasingly popular but the problem is, it is hard to modify the lessons based on the student's individual needs as a teacher can when teaching in person and seeing the student's reactions firsthand. This technology would allow teachers to have online lessons in their classroom with the lessons still being fitted to the student's individual needs.

Sometimes it is hard for teachers to gauge how students feel about certain topics. Students are not always honest with how they feel, especially when they need help. This new technology provides the solution to this problem. The computer could monitor the student's emotions during certain lessons on certain topics and then compile this information for the teacher to analyze. Using this data, the teacher could see how each individual kid is feeling about topics and know who is confused and needs more help and who is ready to move on to something harder. The teacher could also see the percentage of the student's emotions as shown in the article. This is priceless for teachers as it allows them to gain undertsanding of their student's emotions towards what they are learning and allows the teacher to act accordingly.

When learning from a physical teacher, students can emotionally connect with them which enables them to feel more comfortable with the material and what they are learning. Computers do not have this. However, with this new facial action recognition technology students would be able to connect with the computer more because they know the computer is recognizing their emotions and acting accordingly. The students would feel understood. Students being able to connect more with online learning is a major development and could ultimately revolutionalize online education.

Critics of this technology may argue that it cannot replace human interaction and the human connection between student and teacher. While this is true, this technology is not aiming to replace this interaction but instead, enrich it. If the teacher is more aware of the student's emotions, the connection can deepen and the teacher can help the student in ways the teacher did not know the student needed help previously. This technology allows education to grow and become more personalized. It is not trying to replace the human interaction and connection of teaching but enable it to grow.

Modifying online lessons based on the student's emotions, teachers having knowledge of how their students feel about topics, and students being able to connect with online learning are all perfect examples of how valuable this technology in classrooms truly is. Some people may argue that technology can not replace human interaction, but that is not what this technology is for. It is for enhancing the connection between students and teachers. This new technology has many assets and many ways that it can be valuably used in a classroom.",670
