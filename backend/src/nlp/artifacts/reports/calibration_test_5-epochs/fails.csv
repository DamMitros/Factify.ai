Today, almost everyone has a cell phone, especially if they are old enough to drive. Cell phone use while driving has become a big controversy over the last few years and many people have faced the consequences of texting, calling, or searching their cell phones while operating a vehicle. With that being said, there are several reasons why people should not use their phones while driving. These reasons can be classified into a couple of different categories, including safety and legal reasons.

The first reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it can result in injury or death for the driver or someone else. This could pose a safety hazard and would therefore fall under the safety category. Statistically, there are 1.6 million car crashes that are caused by texting and driving each year. Almost 390,000 injuries each year from accidents involve a cell phone or other device. Also, 1 out of every 4 car accidents are caused by texting and driving in the U.S. Therefore, there is always a risk that an accident will happen as a result of cell phone use and could harm anyone involved in the accident.

The second reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it can result in property damage for the driver or someone else, which could pose a safety hazard but could also result in someone pressing charges. Therefore, this could be classified under the safety category and the legal category. As mentioned above, crashes due to cell phone use while driving are very common in the United States. It can cause damage to other vehicles, houses, and or company buildings. Whatever your insurance doesn't cover you have to pay out of pocket and these damages can get really expensive. Any insurance claim could also cause your monthly payments to go up.

The last reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it is against the law in many states such as Georgia, which would fall under the legal category. On July 1, 2018, Georgia passed a Hands-Free law that basically says that anyone driving a motor vehicle on a highway in Georgia is not allowed to hold a phone with any part of their bodies. A first-time offense for using a cell phone and driving is $50, the second is $100, and the third is $150. Each offense after the third one is also $150 each. Every offense is a misdemeanor that would go on your permanent record.

There are multiple reasons why you should not use your phone while driving. This distracted driving can lead to car wrecks that could cause harm to you, to someone in your car, or to anyone else involved in the accident. An accident could also cause damage to your car, to someone else's car, or to homes, buildings, and other property damage. It is also illegal in many other states so if you are caught you could be fined up to $150 and it would go on your permanent record. Because of these potential safety hazards and legal issues, it is best to not use a cell phone while driving a vehicle.",540

It is also a preposturous one. You cannot fully understand what someone is feeling by looking at their face, and attempting to do so is an invasion of their privacy. Facial action coding systems should not be used in classrooms.

The idea that you could fully decipher what someone is feeling based on how they look is absurd. You cannot decide for yourself how someone feels based on the movement of their muscles. For example, if someone looks sad, you cannot just decide that they are sad, just because they look that way. If a machine decides I look confused, does it really have the right to change what I am learning? To understand how someone is really feeling, you have to first ask yourself why they might be feeling that way. Once you understand this, then you can determine what is happening. A machine cannot read minds. If I am confused about one thing, the machine does not know what. Not to mention that people often feel varying emotions at varying times of the day. I might be sad one minute, then laugh at a joke the next. I might not understand something, than understand it in the next second. The machine might automatically change something I understood based on a few seconds of confusion. This is not efficient or helpful.

To read someone's emotions based on their facial expressions is an invasion of their privacy. Let's assume this machine can accurately decipher someone's emotions based on muscle movement. What if you don't want people to know how you're feeling? If I am confused about something, and I am embarrased about it, suddenly the whole word knows. It should be up to the student to decide whether or not they want to seek help, not some magical machine. By forcing students to share private emotions, you run the risk of making them less willing to go to school. Who would want to go to a school where everyone knows how you feel at all times of the day? That would affect learning severely, and would definitely do more harm than good. Hindering learning in an attempt to better understand students is not worth it.

Using this software in classrooms would be ineffective, and even if it did work, it would be a huge invasion of privacy. This software should be used on paintings and nothing more. It is not accurate enough to do anything other than hold back human learning. This software is not fit for classrooms.",435

Do you use your phone while driving? If you said yes, then you need to stop. If you don't then you may end up dead and if you don't believe me then let me tell you some facts. Here is why I don't think people should be able to use their phones while operating a vehicle.

Firstly, driving requires your full attention, but phones compromise this focus. You need to keep both hands on the steering wheel to be the most effective driver. But, every time you text, read messages or talk on a cell phone without a hands-free device, not only is your focus compromised, but you can't keep both hands on the wheel. Phone use when you are driving can also affect your alertness of the surroundings, which can make you prone to collisions. Also, distraction and inattention are the number one cause of traffic accidents and it is estimated that nearly every collision involves one of these two related errors. Driving takes all your attention and it is your responsibility to keep your eyes on the road, so put down the phones and pay attention to the road.

Secondly, people who use a cell phone in the car can drive erratically, which puts others at risk. They may fail to give the proper signals, miss road signs, change lanes abruptly or respond slowly to hazards. Erratic driving patterns can be extremely dangerous to everyone else on the road, including other drivers, pedestrians, and animals. Also, motorist involved in a stressful or emotional phone conversation may exhibit aggressive behavior while they drive, such as road rage. This may cause the erratic driving to worsen and this greatly increases the chance of causing an accident. So, if checking your phone is going to cause you to get mad and drive like you've got no sense and possibly kill someone, then there's no need in even picking it up.

Lastly, there are now legal ramifications when it comes to using phones while driving. You can have criminal penalties placed on you such as fines and tickets and depending on if you had an accident and killed someone you may face more serious criminal consequences such as jail time. Driving with a device can cause you to have higher insurance premiums because insurance rates are tied to a driver's driving history and if you get pulled over for using your phone while driving too many times, it could cause your insurance premiums to spike. Also, you can lose your driving privileges because just like your insurance, you accumulate points for your recklessness. So, if you accumulate too many, you can no longer drive. So, unless your like tickets, fines, jail time, or losing your driver's license, I suggest you wait till you get home to check you phone.

Well there you have it, everything wrong with using your phone while operating a vehicle. Hopefully, you all learned something from this. Hopefully, what you learned was that you shouldn't use your phone while driving. But, if you haven't, that's fine. Just ask yourself a question for me. Is everything you just read worth it for just a minute or two on your phone?",543

One advantage to limiting car usage is that it will cleanse the environment. Cars give off a number of gallons of gas each time they're used. These toxic chemicals found in gases pollute the air. Imagine breathing in all of that waste! Studies have actually found evidence that the toxins from car fuel are very harmful to the health of animals, plants, and humans. It can cause breathing difficulties associated with problems in the lungs when inhaled too heavily as well as it dirties plants and makes it more difficult for them to grow healthy, like they should, and it can even poison and kill the animals. Who wants to take a risk so deadly?

Another advantage to limiting car usage is that it will save citizens money. Cars aren't cheap. Depending on the make and model of the car, they can cost anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000. Insurance and keeping up with the maintenance of a car also costs a lot. Car owners should be expecting to pay 100500 a month for car maintence, and if insurance is required, depending on the state that the car owner lives in, than another additional 100. Finally, is the price for gas. The price for gas in this day in age economy ranges from 3.006.00 per gallon! If a car owner has a long way to drive, but doesn't have a lot of money, heshe may want to consider taking a bus or carpooling with someone to help them out.

A rather more humorous advantage to limiting car usage, is that it could help give citizens a work out. Instead of driving where they need to go, people could walk to their desired destination and burn a ton of calories while doing it! Or in contrast to waiting for a friend to pick them up outside their houses, they could walk to a bus stop and wait for the bus to take them wherever they need to go. This also relates to saving money and helping cleanse the environment. Citizens' will pay less for a gym membership now that they're getting a work out. They'll also be helping the environment by not burning all of those fuel wastes just to get to where they need to go. It's a winwin for everyone!

Of course, there are many advantages to limiting car usage for our citizens, their wallets, and the environment. These three are just a few of the plentiful, conservative ways out there however, they're all extroardinarily efficient.",442

By: Generic_Name

It's becoming too much to bare. Despite the happiness and comfort they gave you all those years ago, they've changed. They're being more critical of you and your other friends, they have been asking you for money frequently without paying back their debt, and are being rude about you not spending time with them, despite them barely spending time with you. Despite you telling them about your concerns, they haven't stopped. You think it's about time you cut ties with your closest friend that you have known since your elementary school days. You ask your mother about what you should do, and she gives you her opinion from the outside looking in. You understand her thinking, but you're not quite satisfied with her answer. You feel as if you should ask someone else, but its not because you dont respect your mom's opinion, you just want another bit of advice. Why is that? Why do we feel the need to get more than one piece of advice after already receiving what we see as a satisfactory answer? Well, there are three reasons this could be. There are more options to consider before making your decision, you can get more diverse and varying opinions, and there are just some people who are more qualified to give you the help and advice that you need.

First, making your decision is much easier when you ask more people, because there are more points to consider. Now this statement may seem contradictory at first. ""How would having to go through more words, people, and ideas help me to get to a clearer understanding of my situation? Wouldn't that just cloud up everything?"" you ask. Well, actually, it does the complete opposite! If you only have one opinion, there's less of a chance that you will find the right answer. It's good to narrow down your points once everything you need is presented, but when you have little to almost nothing to go off of in the first place, it's less likely that your choice will be properly informed. Another reason that you may have trouble only going off of one person, is that somebodies advice could be very biased, which could cloud your mindset from the get go. When someone's advice is based only off of their opinion of the person or thing and not your situation or well being, it can be confusing at best, and directly harmful at worst. Finally, there are plenty more options you can choose from as well. This can make it easier to get the exact answer you need. Think about it like looking for an exact brand of paper you need for work . You may not find it at the first store you go to, you might have to drive around town to find it. All and all, having multiple opinions gives you more things to consider, making it easier to come to your conclusion.

Next, asking more people can get you much more diverse outlooks on the problem at hand. With many different points of view, you would be able to get many different perspectives on an issue. You could get people from the outside looking in, people who have been in that situation before, and even people who might be in the same boat as you. This will make it much easier to not only narrow down your views and options, but can give you all the parts of the story you need to come to a satisfying conclusion. Next,when getting your advice from different, more diverse sources, you might just find out new information that makes you less ignorant on certain issues. When getting advice from different people, you may just find a new outlook on something you hadn't thought of before, which could open up your mind to a whole new insight of your issue. When it comes down to it, getting different opinions from a more diverse crowd could be the difference between a good and bad decision.

Finally, there are some people who may be more qualified than others to handle some situations. For example, there might be some ignorant people who know next to nothing about the other side's situation. When people dont know much about another side's struggles or even their side of the story, they may place too much of their biases onto you or your situation. Another thing, some people have more experience with giving advice. Some people are just more fit to give you advice. For example, who would you be more comfortable taking an opinion from, a friend or a therapist? You may know where to look, but its probably safer to simply get more people's opinions. Even so, sometimes people who aren't in those particular fields tend to think more simply, which might be what you need along with that professional opinion to form a bigger, clearer picture. If you're having trouble picturing what I mean, think of it like a doctor. If you get back your diagnosis and it seems wrong or misinformed, you'll probably end up asking for a second opinion. That way you get a more clear and sensible diagnosis that goes with your symptoms. Furthermore, asking different people for their opinions may just bring in some more qualified ideas into your argument.

As you can clearly see, having a variety of different ideas, opinions, and arguments from many different people is the best way to get your advice, hence why so many people do so. We get a variety of ideas, get more diverse outlooks from many different people and perspectives, and some people having more qualified opinions from different people, is why its so common to get as many points of view that we can. If we want to be as thorough and informed as possible, it is crucial to do just that. Now, you've talked to both your mother and friends, asked internet forums about relationships your questions and have even gotten some replies from certified professionals. You looked through all of the major points that people brought up and have narrowed down your options. Some of your friends are saying that youre going overboard, but you dont care, this could be a big change in your life. Now, have you made your final decision?

We haven't gone there because its atmosphere contains sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide and reaches 870 degrees Fahrenheit. This means that any exploratory vessel would have to be acid and heat-resistant, and that's not cheap.

The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" says we should study Venus even though it is hard. The author says that Venus is similar to Earth and could have been a place where life existed. The atmosphere could be very dangerous for humans but not for robots. The article also says we could study Venus from a distance using telescopes. We could learn about geology, the atmosphere, and how Venus lost its water. 

I think the author does a great job of supporting their claim that we should explore Venus even though it's difficult. They say it's similar to Earth and we could learn things that would help us on Earth and maybe even find life. They also give ideas on ways to do it without putting humans in danger.

In closing, the author provides excellent reasons to study Venus despite the obstacles. They explain why it's important and how we can do it safely.

The Washington Post,

"" 65% of the workers are hard-working and loves their job. ""Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. For example, they look for someone who is responsible and hard-working, and often they look for a person who has experience."" In some countries, start working at age of 15 years old is mandatory, because it helps to young people to obtain new views about different kind of jobs. Everyone has the capacity to be a responsible in their labor, but some people are hard-working because they want to accomplish their goals, and have an excellent record and experience from the last job is so important.

The first reason why is so important to be a hard-working is because you can accomplish your goals. For example, my friend Generic_Name, she started worked when she was 16 years old, she studied and worked at the same time. Generic_Name worked very hard to accomplished her goals. Generic_Name's goals was: be a teacher, buy a house, a car and save money for the College. It was not easy for her, but she was optimistic. She wake up every morning at 6:00 o'clock to go school, and she always fought for have a better future and accomplished her goals. Generic_Name over time get a lot of experience and she inspired others people to do better their jobs. She won a prize for been doing well her job and supported others to inspire to do an extraordinary job. Working hard is the best way to demonstrate you can work in any place and loves your job.

The second reason is when you are working is important to leave an excellent record, because it help to develop a good characteristics and experience. In some jobs, they call to ask for details about if the person have an excellent record and experience. Furthermore, my uncle Generic_Name, he just moved from New York to California, and he was looking for a new job. Generic_Name worked as an engineer in

Village's Company

. He was doing well his job in New York, but he needed moved. He went to apply in this new place, and the employers called to Village's Company asking for details about how he was doing his job when he was working for them, and then Village's Company says ""Generic_Name was one our best worker we had, he was responsible and he have the knowledge about his job."" The new company hired my uncle because he leave an excellent record. Hiring a person who has experience is important, because it help to develop better a job. Some people may argue that be a responsible and hard-working is not necessary in a job. However, be responsible is so important, because people are getting more experience and more capacity to do their labor. Some people do not like to follow the rules when they are in their jobs.

In conclusion, we can not change the entire world, but start been responsible and working hard in our jobs is beneficial, because it is the place where we can inspire others to do their jobs well and any company will hire us for been excellent workers. Every labor is admirable, and we can care our jobs because it depends we can accomplish any goal we has in our life. We can show a lot characters in our work such as: be respecfull, be on time, and the most important things is love our jobs.",597

I believe students should participate in extracurricular activities because one it keep them out of trouble, two some of the activities keep them healthy, and three they are fun.

One reason students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they keep most students out of trouble. For example, it can keep the students occupied so they don't have to be on the streets. Another example is sometimes these activities can help them relax and keep them calm so they stay out of trouble.

Another reason is some of the activities can keep them healthy. For example students can do football or basketball which keeps them running and keeps them in good shape. They can also do lift training after school which keep them fit and all around healthy.

Last but not least these activities are fun. There are always a lot of activities and you can always find something you like. For example if you like sports there are so many different sports you can do. There are also other things like drama club if you like acting, art club if you like drawing, even robotics club if you like technology and stuff like that.

The population is relying on cars more often to get them to were they need to be. Everyone in the communities are becoming lazier and cannot bother to grab a bike or even a pair of skates to help them get where they need to go. More and more of the population do not want to walk to the store which is usually down the street. Cars have even been polluting the atmosphere causing numerous issues, such as health problems and even a rise in the temperature of the planet. The purpose of this essay is to inform fellow citizens of the advantages of limiting car usage.

By limiting the amount of cars we have in the country or even by reducing the days one can use their car, can dramatically reduce the pollution in the atmosphere and also cause citizens to become more active and healthy. ""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders.""(Source 1, Paragraph 2). Vauban is one community to begin their journey to becoming a car reduced area. ""As a result, seventy percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and fifty-seven percent sold a car to move here.""(Source 1, paragraph 3). As said by one of the residents, ""When  I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heindrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.""(Source 1, paragraph 3).

Paris is another city to take on the challenge of limiting the use of cars. Paris is a city where there is an abundance od smog and pollution. ""After days of near-record pollution Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""

(Source 2, paragraph 10). Because of such effort, ""Congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...""(Source 2, paragraph 14). By limiting car usage citizens have only one option, to get up find a bike or running shoes and set out for the day. By doing this the peoples can become very healtthy and reduce the chances of life treatening illnesses, such as cancer and others such as diabetes and lung and heart problems. Just think of the environment, by using less cars we can lower of even completely stop the effects of global warming which can lower the the rising of the sea and help to stop the destruction of the ozone.

""BOGOTA, Colombia-In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or even took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of trafic jams.""(Source 3, paragraph 20). These simple and energizing activities can get you to where you need to be and also gets and keep you active and moving. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife.""(Source 3, paragraph 24). ""Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift, "" said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and Policy Center.""(Source 4, paragraph 35). The world is changing and with it the health of the people and the condition of the environment.

By taking time from using motor vehicles we can lower the pollution of the world and improve the health of the people who live in it. By lowering the production of cars, citizens will have no choice but to grab their bikes or skates or even running shoes and begin to move. The time is now for the community to change. Many different cities have already started their change with cars and now is the time for you to join in the movement. One step at a time.",686

People with a positive outlook tend to experience are reduced incidence of depression, lower stress levels and are better able to cope with stress causing events, an incresed life span and overall better health. People with a positive outlook on life are also more likely to live healthier lifestyle, and to smoke cigarattes less and drink less alcohol.

Attitude is the way taht we behave and we react to the daily activities, consequently a positive attitude may influence our life and it aspects in a deep way such as how we think, socialize, and even how our health is. All these aspects might be affected by a positive attitude. Actually it is proved that successful people have been influenced by the way they see the circumtances in their life. In other words, successful people see those circumtances with a positive attitude and they see those circumtances as a challange to beat and not like a punishment to suffer. Therefore, these people will be more likely to fight and have success in their life, rather than the ones who see their life as a punishment. Positive attitude might be the key to all the people who want to fulfill their dreams. If everyone would apply these concepts in their lives, they would become happier because they will see that everything including their life, situations, and problems, is under their own control.

Even though there are some people who wonder how to get a good positive attitude, is not simple to get it. Almost every single person that has has a positive attitude is because tehy have had a motivation or a feeling that supports their fight to reach their goal or achievement. When you have a positive attitude, you feel that there is a power inside of you that motivates you to do something or to get involved with something. These people are most commons to have best attitudes of this world.

Having a positive attitude can lead you to the lighter, braver and stronger way to stand against negative attitude.          ",400

The question is whether this technology is actually valuable and for what it could be used for. Experts suggest this technology could be used in a classroom to identify the state of mind of a student to adjust the lesson they are trying to comprehend. But, even though this technology may be helpful to teachers trying to keep students active and engrossed in their lessons, the question arises of whether this techonlogy is actually worth the recources or whether what experts think is a great idea is actually an invasion of privacy.

This technology does sound helpful in the fact that it could gauge the state of mind of a student and help a teacher adjust their teaching methods to accomodate and keep their students students on track. The article did state that the techonology could identify when a student is ""confused or bored"" and then ""modify the lesson"" to keep a student engaged. In this way, the technology is useful in the fact that it adapts to the needs of the student. But what can this program do that a teacher's survey could not? By the way the article talks about how a ""home PC can't handle the complex algorithms"" and about how complex the system is, it makes people wonder just how much this system would cost and how complicated it would be to enstate said system into a classroom. Compared to a quick survey done by a teacher who asks their students how they feel about their methods of teaching, it is seen how the system would be a waste of recourses and money. Therefore, although this system is useful in the fact that it can gauge the emotions of the students, it is not much more useful than a teacher who can do the same thing by questioning their students on their preferences and ideas.

Also, although technology is very much improved in these years, it is still not always accurate and infallible, and therefore may not be suitable for a classroom. The article states that the technology associates each emotion with ""characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a ""false smile"", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.

Lastly, if the physical problems of the technology have not already been offputting, then maybe the moral problem of this technology will sway opinions against using it in a classroom. If this technology really can ""indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"", then this means it can invade people's privacy and indicate an emotion which a person is trying to hide. If a student is feeling sad or feeling stressed about home problems which they are trying to conceal, then the technology detects this and displays it for the teacher and the electronic lesson to see. This is an invasion of privacy, as the teacher does not need to know about a student's homelife or about their feelings outside the classroom. A teachers job should be to monitor how their students are feeling about their lessons, not about how their students are feeling about their life outside of school, and since this technology could pick up on digressing feelings, it should not be used in a classroom where a student's internal feelings are revealed to a teacher. Therefore, using Facial Action Coding could end up being an invasion of privacy that should not be introduced to the classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System is a bad idea for the classroom, as it could incorrectly read a student's emotions and give a misleading output that puts a student off track in their education, and also because it could invade a student's privacy of their inner mind. Therefore, installing this system in schools would be a waste of money and recourses, especially when teachers can gauge how their students are learning by simply asking their students in an anonymous survey how they feel about their teaching methods. In this society, technology is used to fix almost everything, but in this case, scientists should quit trying to force technology on behavioral issues and just let humans interact so they can benefit themselves with communication, no computerized middleman needed.",935

It is an amazing thing to think if every person doesn't drive in one big city that it saves so much pollution going in to the air. Another thing to think about is if everyone in a city didn't drive and walked everywhere, more people would stay healthier by staying in shape. Some people think that owning a car is more stressful than just walking everywhere. If you don't own a car you don't have to pay for insurance, don't have to pay for gas, and don't have to pay for repairs when something goes wrong in a vehicle. To me it sounds like there is a lot of advantages in limiting car use.

One solid reason why not using cars as much is the pollution going in the air. In Paris, France motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at their house or else they would be fined. The next day odd numbered license plates motorists had to leave their vehicles at home. It was a hardship at first to get people to follow these new rules, but after about five days everything started to cool down. The pollution had dropped 60 percent in Paris which is exactly what the city was looking for. Limiting the car usage didn't just save pollution from going in the air, but also there wasn't as much traffic as there usually was. It also made Paris a safer place to be outside and not damage the citizens lungs. The capital city of France also made transportation free MondayFriday to help the cause. Soon enough people that had both license plates could drive on the same day.

In Bogota, Colombia they do a car free day that is becoming popular in that part of the world. It is awesome to think there are 7 million people in that city and none of them are using a car. People that violated this goal on this day were charged a 25 fine. People from other countries came to see how this day worked and they loved it. The mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay said ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders."" You can just imagine all the benefits of everyone not using a car in a city for a whole day. Restaurants and parks would be visited and used more and everyone would be getting more exercise. All in all this idea was genius.

As you can see limiting car usage can help out the area big time that it is taking place. It is better breathing air, businesses like restaurants and parks would be used more and grow steadily, and the city would be taken care of better.",464

To begin with, this could be used to ditermine the hidden human emotions. For instance, when I am having a presentation about a specefic topic, but I cannot know the audence's true feelings against me because people usually flatter and do not show their real thoughts. However, by using this technology, I can figure out if mine was good enough or not from the data.

In other hand, I believe this has to be limited to protect individual human rights. For example, what if I could read emotions that are shown by folks, they would be bewildered because they have their own private feelings. This might become a big and grave issue later.

As a conclusion, technology is much smarter and more intellegent, but does not have abilities to control human rights. Just because that can decearn the emotion rate, does not mean that can know the real problem beyond this technology.",172

Now, the words of a fourteen year old might not mean much to a state senator, especially since it will be four years until I am legally allowed to vote, but please sir, hear me out. I believe that we should keep the Electoral College for many reasons. One, if the president was decided by popular vote, our president might not be the best one for the country. Secondly, if it were up to a popular vote, the president might win, or not win, simply for being a regional favorite.

To start this off, if our president was decided by a popular vote, our president might not be the best thing for our country. As stated in the third article, paragraph 20, ""The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates... to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states."" As you know, tossup state's make the final vote. Therefore, people in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, and they will be the ones with the most information. If it were up to popular vote, then anyone over the age of 18 could randomly pick a winner. Let's be honest, the majority of eighteen year old's will vote on whoever their friends or family vote for, or even the candidate representing their group Democratic or Republic. Many people, if the president was decided by popular vote, would make an uneducated decision on one of the candidates, not studying their choices as much as one would with the Electoral College system in place.

Secondly, if it were up to a popular vote, the president might simply win because he or she is a regional favorite. As stated in the third article, paragraph 19, ""...because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" Also in the paragraph, it states that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. If the president was decided by popular vote, however, can you imagine what it would be like? Take rodney, for example. He was a solid regional favorite in the South. rodney knew that there was no incentive to campaign heavily in the South, because he would not gain any electoral votes by increasing his plurilaty in states he knew he would win. If popularity decided the president, residents of the other regions might feel like their vote would not count, and that the president would have no regard for their interests. Say that popularity did actually determine a winner. While most regions might vote for a certain presidents, the ones that did not would feel like that the man running the country wasnt really ""their president"". However, Mr. Senator, if the Electoral College was to stay, this problem would never exist. With the system we have now, the people vote for your state's electors when they vote for the president. Most states also have a ""winnertakeall"" system. Therefore, the canidate with the most votes in a state win's that state's electors. This lets the voting be even, fair. A popular vote would make the voting unfair to those who did not want that president.

Now, of course, the other view has to be adressed. As stated in the second article, ""Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning... During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" This quote shows that the candidates might not go to a state they know they have no chance in winning. I can see how this could support changing to election by popular vote, and how it could be reasonable. If our president was chosen by popular vote, then he would visit all of the states, trying to win them over. However, there are some strong arguments against this. To begin with, one man would have to visit 50 states, and even if he only visited the majority, there is still a posibility that the state will not vote for him anyways, in the end. If we keep the Electoral College, then the majority of votes in a state would count, not his popularity. As a fourteen year old, I can relate this to highschool. A student can be the most popular student in the school, but they can also be the most rude and mean. And while another student may not be popular, they can be the nicest in the school. If the president was chosen by a popular vote, he might just end up being the worst thing that could happen to the country.

In conclusion, Mr. State Senator, I think that keeping the Electoral College is the best thing for our country. If we changed to election by popular vote, the man or woman might not be the best for our country, and the best man might not win because he is not a regional favorite.

I disagree because if the school board adds more morehours to school, students won't pay much attention to the teacher or staff. Another reason is that students will start disrespecting teachers because they have too many hours and they will start to get more tired or start to go a sleep. I also think that teachers might get anoyed by students replying on why the school board added extra hours of school. I think that instead of adding the extra hours to school, the school board should just make the extra hours optional after school. This should take place after school so kids can come and learn more about life and school.

First of all, I disagree because if the school board adds more hours to school students wouldn't be able to concentrate or pay attention in class. I believe that if students don't pay attention in class or to the teacher, the teacher will get very upset and students will start to get in trouble or would start losing points. I believe that the students don't pay attention in class or to the teacher, they would begin to be disrespectful to teachers and won't be respectful to others. I believe that students should tell their parents to do something about the school board wanting to increase the amount of hours in school. Kids should work very hard and keep up the good work and not be disrespectful to others or to the teacher.

Second of all, I don't agree because I think that students will start to disrupt or question their teacher about why the school board wants to change or increase the amount of hours students have in school. They are going to start asking a lot of question and their teacher isn't going to like that. I think that students should ask the school board why they are going to increase the amount of hours in school. Students should talk to their parents on why the school board is extending the amount of hours. Students should just be able to do the normal hours of school instead of doing extra.

Third of all, I believe that the school board shouldn't increase the amount of hours the should just make it an after school activity. I think that the school board should just make it an after school activity instead of increasing the amount of school for students. The school board shouldn't extened the school hours for students because students can just study hard for something or teachers should go over the subject the are learning about so they can learn and understand. If they just stay after school theyh will get so board and they wouldn't want to be there.

I decline on the idea that the school board wants to increase more hours for students. I decline beacuse students will get very bored and wouldn't want to do anything. The school board should think it over again and not extend or increase the amount of hours for school. ",508

Why does a student's education matter? To me, it is extremely important because it can affect them for their entire life in positive or in negative ways. It could lead them to a job with a seven figure salary, or to work a part-time job at a fast food restaurant making minimum wage. What's also important to me is the learning experience. I believe learning should be fun, interesting, and not stressful for students. That's why I agree with the school board's plan to extend the school day by one and a half hours, because that way, students wouldn't feel rushed and would have more time to learn, teacher will have more time to teach and using new ways, and the school year would be a little shorter.

To begin with, I agree with the school board to extend the school day because students wouldn't feel rushed and they would have more time to learn. Right now, each of our periods are only about 50 minutes, which I think really isn't a lot of time to learn once you start working. If one and a half hours is added to the current school day, we would have at least an hour for each class. This way, the students would have more time to complete projects, assignments, or just have more time to really understand the subject without feeling rushed. I know this because right now, I am working on a project in science class that we only have two class periods to finish, which totals for just about one and a half hours! I am not saying that a little push isn't necessary or beneficial, but the extra time would definitely boost the quality of the student's work at our school without rushing them.

Secondly, I think the school board should increase the school day by one and a half hours because that will let teachers have more time to teach, while using unique ways to do so. With the students having more time to learn, the teachers could potentially also have more time to actually create a better learning experience. Extending the day ensures that teachers would be able to thoroughly explain new concepts and materials, while also teaching using better or more effective methods that wouldn't have been possible because of the shortage of time. For instance, sometimes we have educational scavenger hunts, where the teacher lays the information throughout the campus and we would have to find them. The issue is, we've never been able to finish, not because it wasn't possible to, but because there simply wasn't enough time. Those kinds of educational activities are, in my opinion, very fun, but it's also effective. So if we have more time, I am sure that some teachers would plan and teach more using different ways which are beneficial to both the student and the teacher.

Lastly, the school board's plan to extend one and a half hours to the school day is something I strongly concur with because school will be out earlier in the summer. While I do enjoy school very much, I think summer break is something that everyone looks forward to. The days that are cut down because of the increased time allows students to attend more activities and spend more time together with their families. Even though the students aren't at school, they could still be learning something new on their own. For example, they could be learning how to play an instrument, training for sports, or learning how to speak another language, which are all very helpful for them. Also, the teachers could be attending conferences which let's them collaborate with other teachers on creating newer and more efficient methods to teach, which will help everyone in the long run.

In conclusion, the reasons why I agree with the school board to extend the hours are because students wouldn't feel rushed, teachers would have more time to teach in unique ways, and school will be out sooner in the summer. Although I think there are many more reasons why the school day should be longer, those are the main ones. There are just so many benefits that this extended time would create; possibly having an effect on the entire community. This is not an immense amount of change but it can be a big success, which is why I think you should really consider extending the school hours.

Sincerely,

Society is moving toward an almost completely digital lifestyles, causing the youth to become even more involved in phones, computers, and etc. Although this ongoing innovation is an improvement, it also has made its case as a potential hazard to today's generation. Specifically, when combining the machinery of vehicles, which are capable of killing passengers at personality of cellphones, the result is fatal disaster. Basically, while cellphones are helpful technology, drivers should rarely or never use them when operating any vehicle.

Primarily, as the number of people using cell phones while driving will also increase on streets and highways. At the same time rate, drivers still talk on cell phones and send text messages while driving. They will also engaging in other activities apart from driving. For example, drives will text when driving, and they will dial numbers. Drivers will also receive calls and talk on their devices for long periods of time. Again, driving demands your full attention, and your concentration which is taken away when talking on the phone. However, it means that the driver has to divert his attention to the conversation, which leads to less concentration on the road. All in all, one can connect accidents and cell phone usage while driving to this very diversion of attention.

Furthermore, drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person's life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Ad a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. This puts both drivers and even pedestrians in harm's way.

Overall, it's obvious",378

As we all know today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

I will explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Primarily, I believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle but then there are always extenuating circumstances and we will cover both why I believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle and the extenuating circumstances that may arise.

For instance, let us look at my home State of Georgia.

According to the Department of Driver Services, ""Drives are allowed to use hands free devices (specific ones) and voice to text with hands free devices and allowed to use permanent mounted GPS, Drivers are allowed to make emergency calls and report hazardous road conditions"" (Source:

dds. georgia. gov).

Further according to DDS Commissioner, Spencer R. Moore, ""Georgia law currently prohibits all drivers, regardless of age, from using a wireless telecommunications devise to engage in writing, sending, or reading any text-based communication.

Teen drivers under the age of 18 who possess either a learner's permit or a provisional license are prohibited from using a wireless telecommunications device for any reason, including voice communication, except in cases of emergency or if the care was lawfully parked"" (p. 1)

These laws were enacted because distracted drivers claim lives and injuries.

I am an 18-year old driver and I have the mindset of an 18-year old so speaking for myself, I do not use a cell phone in any capacity while driving not even my navigation system.

Similarly to adjusting my mirrors and my car seat, I set up my navigation device prior to starting the ignition.

To me, personally, it is far more important to me to arrive alive and to not harm others than to have the conveniences of a cell phone while driving.

Conclusion

In conclusion, primarily, I believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle but then there are always extenuating circumstances and I have covered both why I believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle and the extenuating circumstances that may arise.

Studies show that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. You should always ask more than one person for advice because the one person you ask may not know as much about the topic as someone else might. For example, if you ask your brother or sister for advice on how to pay taxes, they may not have as much wisdom as your mom and your dad do. On the other hand if you ask your mom or dad for advice on what brands are in style right now, she may not know as much as your brother or sister would. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because someone else might have more knowledge on the topic, they might not have as much wisdom as someone else, and they may be too old or too young for them to give you good advice.

The first reason why you should always ask more than one person for advice when seeking it is because someone else might have more knowledge on the topic. Say that you need to know how to do a math problem. If you go home and only ask your mom how to do it she might not be totally sure how to do it and you might get the problem wrong. Therefore you would be better of asking a few people in your math class how to do it. That is why you should ask people for advice that have knowledge on the topic.

The next reason why you should always ask more than one person for advice when seeking it is because they might not have as much wisdom as someone else. When you get older and need to know how to do taxes you should ask both of your parents not your siblings. Again if you ask your brother or sister for advice on how to pay taxes, they won't have as much wisdom as your mom and dad would. That is why you should ask people with wisdom if you need advice.

The final reason why you should ask more than one person for advice when seeking it is because they might be too old or too young to give you good advice. Going back to the clothing thing, if you need to know what brands are in style you shouldn't ask your parents because they might be too old to know. You also shouldn't ask your younger siblings because they may be too young to know. Therefore you should ask one of your older siblings or maybe even one of your friends. That is why you should ask people that are the appropriate age for advice.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because someone else might have more knowledge on the topic, they might not have as much wisdom as someone else, and they may be too old or too young for them to give you good advice. Those are all great reasons supporting why you should always seek multiple opinions when asking for advice. All of these things can help you make a better choice. That is why you should always seek multiple opinions when asking for advice.",554

Nowadays, manufacturers and creators of products are using technologies and algorithims to analyze everything from shopping preferances, to the economic strengths and weaknesses that characterize a specific a consumer. Not to mention, with facial recognition, and widespread survelliance, complex human interactions are beginnning to be broken down into code. While some may argue against this simply because the idea of being ""watched"" does not appeal to them, these advancements have real-world applications that could actually be quite beneficial to society as a whole. The concept of the FACS program being implemented in classrooms is a concept that really should be taken into heavy consideration. The practical applications of something such as an emotional analysis program within schools, have no end. For this reason, it is concievable that the FACS program should be introduced into the fabric of the modern schooling system.

Imagine if a computer was able to comprehensively custom-tailor lessons for struggling students, based solely on their unconscious reactions to other lessons. Often times this is exactly what a student needs, and what many student activist groups have been proposing for years. The notion that a student could have a lesson that was customized to fit his or her personality, might be exactly what some parents of stuggling (and academically adept) students have been craving. In the article, Making Mona Lisa Smile, by Nick D'Alto, it is stated that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This is a compelling argument for a fairly simple reason; most students that do not do well in school, claim that it is because they do not enjoy it, or that they do not appreciate the way that information is conveyed to them. However, this can be remedied. The implementation of the FACS program within schools would provide an alternitave to traditional teaching, and could improve the overall experience of students. Besides that, the FACS program could also be used to analyze the general student reaction to a specific topic or concept. This would provide teachers with more insight into the lives and emotions of their students, and allow them to better prepare lectures, and their coverage of that topic. The article also states that, "" Most human communictation is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" Not only would the gathered information be beneficial to other parties for the betterment of schooling, but it would also allow school systems to pick up on particular emotional cues that may only be visible to someone who is emotionally close to a particular student.

This program, without a doubt, offers many helpful options when it comes to its use within school systems. The FACS system should be implemented into the fabric of modern schooling. With so many applications, It would be foolish not to at least experiment with it in a school setting. While it is true that privacy and reliability are great concerns for many people, convenience and better academics are also great concerns in today's modern society. In a culture that is beginning to value knowledge over all else, it is important for schools to employ every method available to them, to better prepare students for the life ahead of them. Technology should not be viewed as an enemy in an academic world. Rather, it should be percieved as a tool. A tool that gives humanity the ability to accomplish whatever can be dreamed, and gives it the resources necessary to lead its people into a golden era of knowledge and education.",611

The Importance of Seeking Multiple Opinions Before a Decision

Nowadays online shopping has become more and more common, resulting in the majority of people to refer to the web when purchasing items. However, the items shown on websites may not always be parallel to what it is like in real life. Making a first-hand decision can often lead to something that is unwanted, not satisfactory, or a waste of money. To prevent this, people should seek multiple opinions to help them make a better choice now and possibly in the future. This is why asking advice from more that one person is beneficial and how it helps someone gain the confidence to know that the decisions they make are correct.

Most of the times the choices someone will make causes an effect on another thing. When a bad decision is made, this can lead to circumstances that someone would rather stay away from. For example, a person has spent money on something they wanted, but later realize it was bad quality and it was not what they expected it to be. This does not only put them in a place where they have something that is disliked, but now they have also wasted their time and money when that item was bought. Instead, that person should look up that item to see what other people had to say about it or ask peers who have purchased that item their thoughts on it. This will not only bring them to a choice that they will not regret, but it will also save them from wasting time and money.

The choices someone will make are usually decided on their point of view, meaning that their decision are based solely of what they think. When someone goes to multiple viewpoints, they can see the different perspectives on how people view things. This will lead them to be more open-minded on what they choose to do. Having a more open-mind can then lead to better choices and wisdom for the future. For example, if someone knows that a specific company provides low quality items, they can know that in the future they should not buy items from that company. This means that what a person learns from making a good decision from others opinions now, can also help them make other better decisions in the future.

Many say that you should ""follow your gut,"" but this can lead to many difficult positions. Instead, someone should always seeking multiple opinions to help with choosing what to do because it can insure that they make the best choice. When a person makes a right decision, this does not only give them a decision that they will not regret, but it will also save them from wasting time and money. Choosing the right thing to do now can also help them in the future when making decisions related to their past scenario. The decision someone makes might seem small on the outside, but truly when a good choice is made, this can change a persons life for the best. That is why making a right choice is important, and a person can only make the best decision when they have talked with more than one person.",548

They can provide reliable transportation from one place to another, but we could benefit greatly from limiting our drastic use of motorized vehicles.

While cars maintain their status as one of the largest transportation mediums, they are also beginning to rival powerplants in their emissions of greenhouse gases. For example, in America and many EU countries, Motorized vehicles are second in to powerplants in greenhouse gas emissions.

Now, since greenhouse gases are contributing to global warming, and cars are a major contributor to those emissions, it would be beneficial to cut down on our usage of them. In Paris, smog levels had reached such a dramatic level that the government placed a partial ban on motorized vehicles to cut down car emissions. In the suburbs of an experimental community of Vauban, Germany, 70% of residents do not own cars as a result of there being no roadways save on the outskirts that lead to the downtown area.",175

For example, a boy is challenged with the option of running for the highest leadership in his community. What shall he do to make sure that he is making the right choice? To put it simply, your average boy next door has the opportunity to be a youth leader in his community. With natural leadership skills, his parents have no doubt that we would make a good leader, but doubt still seems to be a deciding factor. Our boy is faced with doubt and overwhelming uncertainty of his options. With so much going on, he has no idea of what he should, and can do. Would you, as his neighbor help him? When people have a decision to make, consulting more than one person can oftentimes lead to the better choice. Sometimes, others can have more knowledge than you, and therefore would be a better source. Others, especially adults with more experience can even tell you possible outcomes of your decision. Seeking advice from people with experience, knowledge, and wisdom can help you make the right decision.

More than one set of eyes on a topic can be a good thing sometimes. With more people reviewing your choices they could catch mistakes, or even tell you what you could do to improve your idea or choice. For example, when I wanted to buy a new camera, I was torn between so many different options. After asking my parents, friends, and family, I finally made the best choice for my money. Even when you have a small decision to make, like what to buy for lunch, asking your friends could help you get the best option they have to offer. Even when the President is making decisions, he too has people he can ask for advice. No matter what choice or decision you have to make, asking others for advice is a healthy option.

When others have more knowledge than you, their opinions and advice can be more in depth, practiced, or even more intelligent. To put it into perspective, if you have a question on math homework, asking the teacher would be more beneficial that asking your peer, or table mate. If you want to switch classes, or change your schedule, asking a counselor, or teacher with more knowledge than you can help you make the right decision too. Even when a high school student is applying to college, they too would ask their parents for advice. Using other's experienced advice, older knowledge and wisdom can lead you down the road to the right choice.

When making a big decision, sometimes asking somebody who has done such a thing before can tell you the outcome, or give you experienced advice. If a girl wants to get contacts, she could ask her parents, family members, or teachers who have had contacts before for advice. They themselves have had it before, so they would know the outcome, and therefore would be a great resource for advice. I know that when I wanted to go to summer camp, I asked my teacher who had been there before. She knew what it was like, and could tell me all about it so I knew I was making the right decision. Even when an aspiring actor or singer wants to join the industry, they too ask those who have gone through the same process for advice, or what to expect as an outcome. Asking those with experience, or previous knowledge can not only help you make the right choice, but also tell you about an outcome that the choice might provide.

Seeking advice from people with experience, knowledge, and wisdom can most definitely help you make the right decision. So, would you help the boy next door? If you have been through what he is experiencing, would you offer him advice? It can be tough to find people, but more than one person reviewing a topic or choice can help someone make the right decision. Having other people review your decision, or asking multiple sources can sometimes help you make the right choice. Even asking more experienced individuals can help too. When asking someone who has more in-depth knowledge, or is wiser, you can receive advice that you wouldn't have thought of. Even when making a big decision, like our boy next door, you can ask people who have done such things before. When asking those who have experienced first hand the choices you want to make, you can get opinions or advice from more experienced individuals. When you ask others for help, advice, or opinions, you have the chance to dive into a world of possibilities. When asking more than one person, you can experience even more possibilities. Asking other can give you the best help you may ever receive.",812

I'm going to explain why I believe that my claim is correct.

First, it is clearly obvious that the face only appers as a face because of low resolution cameras and odd shadows, as you can see from the most recent photographs of the rock face. Even in the 1998 picture it is pretty clear that it is not in fact a face but is just a rock formation. The clouds obscure some of the face in the 1998 picture so it might not be conclusive, but the 2001 picture proves it.

Also, if there were alien life of Mars, that would skyrocket NASA's budget to get to Mars because the public would be going crazy and the whole world would want to know. If there were alien life on Mars and NASA was the administration to discover it, the whole world's eyes and wallets would be on them, expecting them to put some men on mars to try to make contact with the Martian life forms, thus winning the race to put astronauts on Mars.

In conclusion, I believe that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a rock formation and nothing more than that. There are clear reasons as to why NASA would want this to be alien life more than anyone, and reasons why they would not keep it a secret from the public.",254
