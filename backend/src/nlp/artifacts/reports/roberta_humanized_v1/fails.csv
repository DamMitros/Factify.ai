For example, a product say a shampoo or some beauty product is advertised in an extra-ordinary manner with a beautiful woman, a serene background, a great and pompous music and captivating puchlines and narration. But, in reality I don't think the product would be so great. It would be like any other beauty product that we may be using with slight differences in colour, odour and ofcourse, the price. Most companies advertise their products in this manner because, they have to compete with other companies which manufacture similar products. Each manufacturing company wants to be ahead of all of it's counterparts. So, each company tries to advertise it's product in a unique manner so that conmsumers are attracted towards it's products. They advertising procedure is unique but the products will be some what similar. This is because, a product manufactured to meet a particular requirement has more or less the same ingredients. For example, basic ingredients of a cold cream will always be the same. So, each manufacturer has to use the same basic ingredients to manufature the cold cream. The things which can be different are the colour and odour of the cold cream, it's packing style etc. Other reasons for such pompous advertisements could be to lure the consumers to buy more and more of their products. If advertising is done in a grand way by involving a popular personality or a celebrity then that would attract more attention and will help in the increasing the sales of the product. For example, if a product is endorsed by a hollywood star, then many of his/her fans and admirers would buy the product out of their adulation towards the star.

They can provide reliable transportation from one place to another, but we could benefit greatly from limiting our drastic use of motorized vehicles.

While cars maintain their status as one of the largest transportation mediums, they are also beginning to rival powerplants in their emissions of greenhouse gases. For example, in America and many EU countries, Motorized vehicles are second in to powerplants in greenhouse gas emissions.

Now, since greenhouse gases are contributing to global warming, and cars are a major contributor to those emissions, it would be beneficial to cut down on our usage of them. In Paris, smog levels had reached such a dramatic level that the government placed a partial ban on motorized vehicles to cut down car emissions. In the suburbs of an experimental community of Vauban, Germany, 70% of residents do not own cars as a result of there being no roadways save on the outskirts that lead to the downtown area.",175

Because tavelling with the group make me to share more things with different peoplewho wre in the group. Travelling in a group with guide will make me to know the new placs which ihd never visited before. Guide will explain the entire information about the place. Travelling in group make more advantages becuse if the information about a place is not known to the guide I will try to know the information with my colleagues who are in the group. Tour guide will probably have a clear idea of which place is mare important than those of others. If we are having a little time to explore new places in the country it is suitable to take an idea from the tour guide. Travelling in a group makes me more enthusiatic to know the new things. If I had visited the place early I will try to explain the place I had visited. If iwill travell in a group it will keep me away from the lazyness. I will try to know the different cultures that exist in a country and the ideas of different people how they are thinking. Whether they are thinking in a positive manner or in a negative manner. Travelling in agroup makes me more attention and concentration that I had. People with inthe group makes me more enjoyable while travelling. It will release my tensions and problems. The travelling with the group maske me easy to travell because it will not let me know how much time I travelled. I can travellmore long distances with the group.

What is the most important thing you have learned from your travels? I have learnt a lot from my travels. I learnt that the world is a big place and there are so many things to see and do in it. I have also learned that there is no such thing as a perfect place to visit. There is always something to learn and discover.
